      "Young workers have been hit hardest by COVID fallout, says UN labour agency\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501131095/young-workers-have-been-hit-hardest-by-covid-fallout-says-un-labour-agency/\n",
      "The number of young people globally who can’t find a job this year is set to reach 73 million – that’s a full six million more than before Covid-19 – the UN labour agency said on Thursday.According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the pandemic has caused many additional problems for 15 to 24-year-olds who’ve experienced “much higher” unemployment losses than older workers since the global health emergency was declared in early 2020.Young women have struggled more than their male counterparts to find work, while Arab nations are expected to see the highest levels of youth unemployment by the end of the year, compared to the global average.“We know that the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on youth labour markets around the world,” said Martha Newton, ILO Deputy Director-General for Policy. “It’s exposed a number of shortcomings in the way the needs of young people are addressed, especially the most vulnerable first-time job seekers, school dropouts, fresh graduates with little experience and those who remain inactive not by choice.”Speaking at the launch of ILO’s report, Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022: Investing in transforming futures for young people, Ms Newton said that the share of youth not in employment, education or training in 2020 rose to 23.3 per cent.That represents an increase of 1.5 percentage points from 2019 and represents a level not seen in at least 15 years, the ILO report found.“This group of young people are at particular risk of seeing their labour market opportunities and outcomes deteriorate also over the longer-term as ‘scarring’ effects take hold,” the report noted.Gender inequalityThe report’s takeaways include the worrying finding that young women are worse off than young men when it comes to finding a job. This year, fewer than three in 10 young women globally are expected to be in work, compared to well over four in 10 young men.“The gender gap, which has shown little sign of closing over the past two decades, is largest in lower-middle-income countries, at 17.3 percentage points, and smallest in high-income countries, at 2.3 percentage points,” the ILO report stated.Only high-income countries on course to recoverLatest labour data scrutinised by ILO also indicated that only high-income counties are likely to see a recovery in youth unemployment levels “close to those of 2019” by the end of this year.In lower-income countries, youth unemployment rates are projected to remain more than one percentage point above pre-crisis values.In Africa, the continent’s youth unemployment rate of 12.7 per cent masks the fact that many youths have chosen to withdraw from the labour market altogether, ILO said. It noted that “over one in five young people in Africa was not in employment, education, or training in 2020, and the trend has been deteriorating”.The Arab States have the highest and the fastest growing unemployment rate of young people worldwide, projected at 24.8 per cent in 2022. “The situation is worse for young women in the region, with 42.5 per cent unemployment in 2022, which is almost three times as high as the global average for young women (14.5 per cent),” ILO said.In Europe and Central Asia, unemployment among 15 to 24-year-olds is expected to be 1.5 per cent higher than the rest of the world this year (16.4 per cent compared with 14.9 per cent). Although there has been “substantial progress” in reducing youth unemployment for both women and men, ILO said that the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “highly likely to affect the results”.While the Asia Pacific region is set to see 14.9 per cent of young workers still looking for a job by the end of the year, in line with the global average, the picture will likely remain worrying in Latin America, where the rate is expected to be 20.5 per cent.“Historically, young women’s unemployment rates have been higher than young men’s (in Latin American countries), but the crisis exacerbated this trend,” ILO’s report stated.The picture is radically different in North America, however, where the youth and young adult unemployment rate is expected to be well world average levels, at 8.3 per cent.Solutions are green and blueTo address the problem, the UN labour agency urged governments to implement sustainable green and blue (ocean) policy measures. According to the report, this could generate an additional 8.4 million jobs for young people by 2030.Targeted investments in digital technologies could also absorb high numbers of young workers, ILO maintained. By achieving universal broadband coverage by 2030, some 24 million new jobs could be created worldwide it said, with young workers taking 6.4 million of them. UN News \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130955/fiscal-stimulus-high-vaccination-rates-fuel-cambodias-economic-growth-outlook-report/\n",
      "Strong fiscal stimulus and high vaccination rates have helped quickened Cambodia’s economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, an ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report said on Thursday.In its Cambodia Economic Outlook 2022, the AMRO said the Cambodian economy has been resilient, adding that the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions boosted domestic activity while strong external demand supported the economic recovery in the first half of 2022.“The Cambodian economy is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2022, up from 3 percent in 2021,” AMRO deputy group head and senior economist Jinho Choi said in a news release.“We expect the domestic economy to continue to improve, supported by high vaccination rates and enhanced health protocols,” he said.“However, the outlook for exports will be challenging as the United States and the European Union are expected to slow down sharply in the second half of this year, which could weigh heavily on the garment sector,” Choi added.The report said Cambodia’s new investment law, and the greater market access through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) will provide a strong boost to investments that will help modernize and diversify the kingdom’s economy.It also highlighted some downside risks to Cambodia’s growth, including a slowing global demand amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and monetary tightening in the United States and Europe.According to the report, Cambodia’s inflation was forecast to rise to 5.9 percent in 2022, up from 2.9 percent last year, fuelled by soaring global energy and food prices.Cambodia has so far administered COVID-19 vaccines to 15.14 million people, or 94.6 percent of its 16 million population, and China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines have been widely used in the kingdom’s immunization programs.Cambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesperson Penn Sovicheat said high vaccination rates, the RCEP, and the CCFTA are the key factors of boosting the country’s post-pandemic economic growth.“Under the RCEP and the CCFTA, which both took effect earlier this year, we are confident that Cambodia’s exports to China and other RCEP participating countries will be bigger, especially the exports of potential agricultural products such as rice, bananas and mangoes, industrial products, and processing goods,” he told Xinhua.The RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Ky Sereyvath, a senior economist and director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, agreed that fiscal stimulus, high vaccination rates and free tree agreements are the boosters for Cambodia’s economic growth.“Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have not only protected millions of Cambodian people’s lives and stabilized the health system, but also helped boost Cambodia’s economic recovery,” he told Xinhua.\n",

This clearly shows that the Southeast Asian nation is a potential destination for both domestic and foreign investors, especially for the Chinese ones,” he told Xinhua.“New investment has not only brought in new capital, but also advanced technologies as well as new jobs for Cambodians,” he added.

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130562/21-rise-in-cambodias-trade-us-the-biggest-export-market/\n",
      "Cambodia’s international trade rose to $32.82 billion in the first seven months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent, and the United States is the biggest market for the country accounting for 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports.From January to July, Cambodia exported $13.78 billion worth of goods to foreign markets, up 30.7 percent compared to the same period last year, showed the latest report of the General Department of Customs and Excise.The Kingdom’s total imports rose by 15.4 percent during the same period to $19.05 billion.The US remains the biggest market for Cambodian products, with 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports or $5.69 billion, a 47.3 percent year-on-year increase, the report underlined. The spike in exports to the US is remarkable considering the still pending renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Vietnam and China were ranked second and third, importing $1.32 billion and $701 million worth of products from Cambodia, respectively, it added. Meanwhile, China remained the largest trading partner of Cambodia, followed by the US, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore, the report said.Trade volume between Cambodia and China was valued at $6.97 billion in the first seven months of 2022, up 15.6 percent year-on-year.The report noted that trade with China accounted for 21 percent of Cambodia’s total trade volume of 32.8 billion dollars during the January-July period.The resumption of socio-economic activities, trade pacts such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and bilateral free trade agreement with China have been cited as reasons for the spurt in production and trade. The significant growth in production and trade is also due to Cambodia’s high vaccination rates.Garment, footwear and travel goods shared almost 50 percent of the total commodity exports, followed by non-garment products and agricultural products.Dr Ky Sereyvath, Director of the Institute of China Studies and economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Khmer Times that the early reopening of the economy had helped the revival of the production chain leading to the spike in exports.“The trend indicates that the total trade will return to the pre-Covid-19 level soon,” Dr Sereyvath said. “But orders for the garment sector have seen a drop due to the European crisis (following the Russia-Ukraine war),” he noted.“Cambodia still has a number of preferential trade systems, such as the Everything But Arms (EBA) of European Union. But, exports can still go down later this year due to the crisis in Europe and global inflation,” Dr Sereyvath said.There was also relocation of factories from neighbouring countries to Cambodia to take advantage of the early reopening of the economy and this has also contributed to the spike in production and exports.\n",
