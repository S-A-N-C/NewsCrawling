      "Young workers have been hit hardest by COVID fallout, says UN labour agency\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501131095/young-workers-have-been-hit-hardest-by-covid-fallout-says-un-labour-agency/\n",
      "The number of young people globally who can’t find a job this year is set to reach 73 million – that’s a full six million more than before Covid-19 – the UN labour agency said on Thursday.According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the pandemic has caused many additional problems for 15 to 24-year-olds who’ve experienced “much higher” unemployment losses than older workers since the global health emergency was declared in early 2020.Young women have struggled more than their male counterparts to find work, while Arab nations are expected to see the highest levels of youth unemployment by the end of the year, compared to the global average.“We know that the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on youth labour markets around the world,” said Martha Newton, ILO Deputy Director-General for Policy. “It’s exposed a number of shortcomings in the way the needs of young people are addressed, especially the most vulnerable first-time job seekers, school dropouts, fresh graduates with little experience and those who remain inactive not by choice.”Speaking at the launch of ILO’s report, Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022: Investing in transforming futures for young people, Ms Newton said that the share of youth not in employment, education or training in 2020 rose to 23.3 per cent.That represents an increase of 1.5 percentage points from 2019 and represents a level not seen in at least 15 years, the ILO report found.“This group of young people are at particular risk of seeing their labour market opportunities and outcomes deteriorate also over the longer-term as ‘scarring’ effects take hold,” the report noted.Gender inequalityThe report’s takeaways include the worrying finding that young women are worse off than young men when it comes to finding a job. This year, fewer than three in 10 young women globally are expected to be in work, compared to well over four in 10 young men.“The gender gap, which has shown little sign of closing over the past two decades, is largest in lower-middle-income countries, at 17.3 percentage points, and smallest in high-income countries, at 2.3 percentage points,” the ILO report stated.Only high-income countries on course to recoverLatest labour data scrutinised by ILO also indicated that only high-income counties are likely to see a recovery in youth unemployment levels “close to those of 2019” by the end of this year.In lower-income countries, youth unemployment rates are projected to remain more than one percentage point above pre-crisis values.In Africa, the continent’s youth unemployment rate of 12.7 per cent masks the fact that many youths have chosen to withdraw from the labour market altogether, ILO said. It noted that “over one in five young people in Africa was not in employment, education, or training in 2020, and the trend has been deteriorating”.The Arab States have the highest and the fastest growing unemployment rate of young people worldwide, projected at 24.8 per cent in 2022. “The situation is worse for young women in the region, with 42.5 per cent unemployment in 2022, which is almost three times as high as the global average for young women (14.5 per cent),” ILO said.In Europe and Central Asia, unemployment among 15 to 24-year-olds is expected to be 1.5 per cent higher than the rest of the world this year (16.4 per cent compared with 14.9 per cent). Although there has been “substantial progress” in reducing youth unemployment for both women and men, ILO said that the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “highly likely to affect the results”.While the Asia Pacific region is set to see 14.9 per cent of young workers still looking for a job by the end of the year, in line with the global average, the picture will likely remain worrying in Latin America, where the rate is expected to be 20.5 per cent.“Historically, young women’s unemployment rates have been higher than young men’s (in Latin American countries), but the crisis exacerbated this trend,” ILO’s report stated.The picture is radically different in North America, however, where the youth and young adult unemployment rate is expected to be well world average levels, at 8.3 per cent.Solutions are green and blueTo address the problem, the UN labour agency urged governments to implement sustainable green and blue (ocean) policy measures. According to the report, this could generate an additional 8.4 million jobs for young people by 2030.Targeted investments in digital technologies could also absorb high numbers of young workers, ILO maintained. By achieving universal broadband coverage by 2030, some 24 million new jobs could be created worldwide it said, with young workers taking 6.4 million of them. UN News \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130955/fiscal-stimulus-high-vaccination-rates-fuel-cambodias-economic-growth-outlook-report/\n",
      "Strong fiscal stimulus and high vaccination rates have helped quickened Cambodia’s economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, an ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report said on Thursday.In its Cambodia Economic Outlook 2022, the AMRO said the Cambodian economy has been resilient, adding that the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions boosted domestic activity while strong external demand supported the economic recovery in the first half of 2022.“The Cambodian economy is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2022, up from 3 percent in 2021,” AMRO deputy group head and senior economist Jinho Choi said in a news release.“We expect the domestic economy to continue to improve, supported by high vaccination rates and enhanced health protocols,” he said.“However, the outlook for exports will be challenging as the United States and the European Union are expected to slow down sharply in the second half of this year, which could weigh heavily on the garment sector,” Choi added.The report said Cambodia’s new investment law, and the greater market access through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) will provide a strong boost to investments that will help modernize and diversify the kingdom’s economy.It also highlighted some downside risks to Cambodia’s growth, including a slowing global demand amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and monetary tightening in the United States and Europe.According to the report, Cambodia’s inflation was forecast to rise to 5.9 percent in 2022, up from 2.9 percent last year, fuelled by soaring global energy and food prices.Cambodia has so far administered COVID-19 vaccines to 15.14 million people, or 94.6 percent of its 16 million population, and China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines have been widely used in the kingdom’s immunization programs.Cambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesperson Penn Sovicheat said high vaccination rates, the RCEP, and the CCFTA are the key factors of boosting the country’s post-pandemic economic growth.“Under the RCEP and the CCFTA, which both took effect earlier this year, we are confident that Cambodia’s exports to China and other RCEP participating countries will be bigger, especially the exports of potential agricultural products such as rice, bananas and mangoes, industrial products, and processing goods,” he told Xinhua.The RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Ky Sereyvath, a senior economist and director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, agreed that fiscal stimulus, high vaccination rates and free tree agreements are the boosters for Cambodia’s economic growth.“Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have not only protected millions of Cambodian people’s lives and stabilized the health system, but also helped boost Cambodia’s economic recovery,” he told Xinhua.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130562/21-rise-in-cambodias-trade-us-the-biggest-export-market/\n",
      "Cambodia’s international trade rose to $32.82 billion in the first seven months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent, and the United States is the biggest market for the country accounting for 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports.From January to July, Cambodia exported $13.78 billion worth of goods to foreign markets, up 30.7 percent compared to the same period last year, showed the latest report of the General Department of Customs and Excise.The Kingdom’s total imports rose by 15.4 percent during the same period to $19.05 billion.The US remains the biggest market for Cambodian products, with 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports or $5.69 billion, a 47.3 percent year-on-year increase, the report underlined. The spike in exports to the US is remarkable considering the still pending renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Vietnam and China were ranked second and third, importing $1.32 billion and $701 million worth of products from Cambodia, respectively, it added. Meanwhile, China remained the largest trading partner of Cambodia, followed by the US, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore, the report said.Trade volume between Cambodia and China was valued at $6.97 billion in the first seven months of 2022, up 15.6 percent year-on-year.The report noted that trade with China accounted for 21 percent of Cambodia’s total trade volume of 32.8 billion dollars during the January-July period.The resumption of socio-economic activities, trade pacts such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and bilateral free trade agreement with China have been cited as reasons for the spurt in production and trade. The significant growth in production and trade is also due to Cambodia’s high vaccination rates.Garment, footwear and travel goods shared almost 50 percent of the total commodity exports, followed by non-garment products and agricultural products.Dr Ky Sereyvath, Director of the Institute of China Studies and economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Khmer Times that the early reopening of the economy had helped the revival of the production chain leading to the spike in exports.“The trend indicates that the total trade will return to the pre-Covid-19 level soon,” Dr Sereyvath said. “But orders for the garment sector have seen a drop due to the European crisis (following the Russia-Ukraine war),” he noted.“Cambodia still has a number of preferential trade systems, such as the Everything But Arms (EBA) of European Union. But, exports can still go down later this year due to the crisis in Europe and global inflation,” Dr Sereyvath said.There was also relocation of factories from neighbouring countries to Cambodia to take advantage of the early reopening of the economy and this has also contributed to the spike in production and exports.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130637/cambodia-weighs-options-to-forsake-ldc-status/\n",
      "Senior government officials and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Wednesday discussed ways to assess the vulnerability of Cambodia when the country leaves the Least Developed Country status, according to a release by the Ministry of Commerce (MoC).The three-day discussion was held at MoC on Wednesday and was led by Bun Chanthy, undersecretary of state of MoC and Junior Davis, director of research and analysis of UNCTAD who presented Cambodia’s stages of leaving LDC status.Cambodia will need to conduct a study on four aspects of its vulnerability that include firstly an analysis of the general situation of its production capacity compared to other countries in the region, second determination of vulnerability based on prosperity, peace, human, environment and partnership, thirdly impacts of vulnerability and lastly policies of economic and environmental resilience.“The study will be conducted by collecting information and data from ministries and institutions in Cambodia for analysis to prepare recommendations for the government so that it will be able to prepare strategies of leaving the status smoothly,” the release said.Junior said that the Kingdom will be reviewed for the second time in 2024 to determine whether or not it can leave LDC after it passed a grade of leaving LDC status first time was in 2021 with the assessment of Gross National Product (GNP), Human Development Index (HDI) and economic and environmental vulnerability.“When leaving LDC status, Cambodia would lose generalised system of preferences, technical frameworks and concessional loans and so on,” Junior said. UNCTAD team will meet government officials in person to discuss further the preparation of the study plan and any concerns regarding leaving the LDC status of Cambodia.On his part Chanthy said Cambodia needs to prepare national strategies for LDC status smoothly without severely being impacted by losing GSP and measures in relation to international aid, especially during a transition period, adding that the government has made efforts to restore and rebuild the country for over three decades after the civil war to achieve and maintain full peace and quicken socio-economic development.During an annual meeting of MoC, Aun Pornmoniroth, Minister of Economy and Finance, said that the ministry needs to pay attention to cooperating with international organisations that are professionally independent and other ministries and institutions to conduct studies on the date and possibility of Cambodia’s leaving LDC status with strength and resilience against external shocks.“Especially, the ministry needs to be well prepared for negotiation to request for GSP Plus to maintain markets, production level and attraction of investment in the country. The ministry also needs to study the impacts of preferences eroded through competition with some other countries that have established bilateral free trade agreements with trade partners of Cambodia,” Pornmoniroth added.Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed optimism recently that Cambodia will definitely achieve its vision of a high-middle-income country by 2030 and attributed it to the country’s peace and economic growth, particularly the socio-economic resumption after the pandemic, adding that in the light of peace, the Cambodian people have achieved great and proud changes, especially in the economic and social fields.“Realising high and sustainable economic growth over the past two decades has moved Cambodia from a low-income country to a low-middle-income country and is striving to achieve its vision of a high-middle-income country in 2030,” the premier said.\n",

      "Cambodia earned $505 million from bicycle exports in the first six months of this year.It also received $15 million from sales in the domestic market, said a senior official at the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation.In a press conference to announce the achievements of the past five years of the ministry at the Office of the Council of Ministers yesterday, Heng Sokkung, Secretary of State and spokesman for the ministry said, “Cambodia is the world’s fifth largest exporter in the bicycle industry and the number one exporter to the European Union.”Cambodia has 13 bicycle factories, including 12 in Svay Rieng and one in Kandal province with an investment of $112 million.”“Before 2020, China was the number one exporter to the European Union, followed by Taipei city. But it changed from 2020 as Cambodia became the largest exporter of bicycles to the EU, accounting for 24 percent of the EU’s total imports, followed by China at 17 percent and Taipei at 11 percent,” he pointed out.The main markets for Cambodia’s bicycles are the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Asean, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Colombia, Republic of Korea, Spain, Slovenia and Canada.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130690/cambodia-china-trade-volume-surges-15-6-to-6-97-billion/\n",
      "The trade volume between Cambodia and China surged 15.6 percent year-on-year to $6.97 billion in the first seven months of this year, a General Department of Customs and Excise report said.China accounted for 21 percent of the Kingdom’s total trade volume of $32.8 billion during the January-July period in 2022.The surge in trade volume helped China retain its position as the largest trading partner of Cambodia.The other top trading partners of the Kingdom were the United States, followed by Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore during the period.Cambodia’s main exports to China included milled rice, bananas, mangos, cassava, fishery and apparel.The Kingdom also imported garment raw materials, machinery, vehicles, foodstuffs, electronics, medicines, etc from China during the period.While talking about the increase in imports, Penn Sovicheat, Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman, told Khmer Times that the trade cooperation between Cambodia and China has been rising despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“China is a huge market for Cambodia, and despite the pandemic, our bilateral trade volume has steadily increased,” Sovicheat said.“The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which came into force this year, played a big role in improving trade relations.“The pacts have been enhancing the trade relations between both countries,” he said.He expressed confidence that the bilateral trade and investment volumes between both nations would continue to grow in the coming years due to the positive impact of the two trade agreements.Sovicheat is also optimistic about a further improvement in trade ties with China as the Kingdom was keen to export more agricultural products to Beijing in the coming years.He also hailed the roles of CCFTA and RCEP for enhancing the country’s agricultural and fruit exports to China.RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 Asean member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Recently, Prime Minister Hun Sen also pointed out the significance of RCEP while speaking at the Asean Day. The Prime Minister said RCEP would be a booster for regional and global economic recovery in the post-Covid era.Mr Hun Sen said the full and effective implementation of the RCEP agreement is a priority.RCEP will stimulate economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, create jobs, and strengthen the supply chain in the region and the world as a whole, he said.“As the chair of Asean 2022, Cambodia will work closely with RCEP countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the agreement to intensify the facilitation of cross-border trade movements further,” the Premier said.According to an Asian Development Bank’s study, the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 per cent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment.Meanwhile, Ky Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said that RCEP and CCFTA have significantly boosted the trade volume between the two Asian nations.“Through RCEP and the CCFTA, I think Cambodia can be a hub-and-spoke model to distribute goods from China to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region in the future,” he told Xinhua.Last month a report from the Council for the Development of Cambodia said the Kingdom attracted fixed-asset investment of $1.29 billion from China in the first half of 2022.China remained the top foreign investor in Cambodia, accounting for 43 percent of the total investment of $2.99 billion the country approved during the first six months of this year, CDC said.The sectors that attracted investment during the period were agriculture and agro-industry, manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure. \n",

      "Cambodia exported $13.78 billion worth of goods in the January-July period of this year, up by 30.7 percent compared to the same period last year, the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) report said on Wednesday.The total value of the Kingdom’s international trade rose by 21.3 percent to $32.82 billion, the report said, citing that imports increased by 15.4 percent to $19.05 billion during the period.The US remains the biggest market for Cambodia’s products, stated the report, citing that export amounted to $5.69 billion, a year-on-year increase of 47.3 percent, accounting for 45.2 percent of the total export.Vietnam is the second largest market with exports at $1.32 billion, followed by China at $701 million.Broken down by sector, garment, footwear and travel goods share almost 50 percent of the total commodity exports, followed by non-garment industry products and agricultural products, the report said.Cambodia’s exports have significantly increased due to the successful and efficient Covid-19 management by the government, leading to the resumption of all kinds of economic activities, said Lim Heng, vice president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.“The government has controlled the Covid-19 situation, reopened borders to tourists, resumed socio-economic activities – leading to keeping the production chains in factories,” Heng said.Trade preferences, the regional free trade agreement – RCEP and Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement are factors opening up wider markets for Cambodia-made products and attracting new investment, he said.The government has launched the strategic framework and program for economic recovery and to promote Cambodia’s economic growth for 2021-2023.Penn Sovicheat, undersecretary of state and spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, attributed the growth to the Cambodia-made products’ quality that has won the confidence of buyers and consumers.“Cambodia is a country with a reputation as a source of large supply with the trust of consumers and buyers. In fact, in the context of the outbreak of Covid-19, Cambodia’s exports continue to grow as some countries fail to supply their markets,” he said in a recent press conference.\n",

      "The Regional Cooperation Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Free Trade Agreement with China have increased manufacturing factories in Cambodia.Cambodia has a total of 1,947 factories with a registered investment value of $15.7 billion as of June this year, the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation’s report said on Thursday.The manufacturing factories produced products worth $7.57 billion in the first half of 2022, a significant rise of 75 percent year-on-year, stated the report, citing that the products worth $5.26 billion were exported and the rest were sold domestically.From January to July of this year, 112 new factories opened while 47 factories closed down.FTA with China, RCEP, and strong demand for Cambodia-made products in the US and Europe, which are Cambodia’s main markets, have built confidence in investors to  invest in Cambodia, Secretary of State and spokesman Heng Sokkung said.“Purchase orders in the US and EU and new markets under the RCEP and with FTA with China and Korea are potential in attracting new investment to the country,” Sokkung told Khmer Times on Thursday.Securing sufficient raw materials to local production chains is another factor in building bold confidence in investors, he said, citing that those raw materials are imported mainly from China.The manufacturing sector is estimated to contribute 39.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022, he said, adding that the sector has created some 1.04 million jobs.Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, attributed the growth in the manufacturing sector to peace, effective pandemic crisis management, regional trade pacts and FTA with China.“The free trade agreement with China and soon with Korea and the RCEP attracted new investors to inject investment in Cambodia while Cambodia controlled Covid-19,” Heng said on Thursday.Increasing global demand is also giving a big boost to the growth of the sector, he said.Among the manufacturing plants in Cambodia, 1,100 are garment, footwear and travel goods factories, and the rest are food and beverage, automotive assembly, cement, electronics, and pharmaceutical factories, among others.The garment, footwear and travel goods industry is the largest foreign exchange earner for Cambodia.However, the non-garment manufacturing products are significantly increasing in value export.Sokkung said the government was diversifying from garment production to non-garment sectors.“We are now boosting investment in the non-garment and textile sector due to its value-addition, pushing technology-based production chains to increase quality and quantity to meet demand,” Sokhung said.New non-garment manufacturing factories that have started operations lately are vehicle tire producing plants and vehicle assembly plants.The non-garment industry product export was $1,520 million in the January-July period of this year, which is a 58 percent increase compared to the same period last year. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130771/singapore-trims-2022-growth-forecast-on-strong-global-headwinds/\n",
      "AFP – Singapore on Thursday narrowed its economic growth forecast this year after the economy contracted in the second quarter compared to the previous three months due to rising inflation and tighter monetary policies, the government said.Moves by central banks worldwide to tighten borrowing costs in order to deal with rocketing prices have weighed down on global demand for Singapore’s exports, with the government painting a grim picture.Economists often see the performance of the city state’s open, trade-driven economy as a barometer for global trading activity.Singapore’s economy is now projected to expand by 3.0 to 4.0 percent this year, trimmed from a 3.0 to 5.0 forecast earlier, the trade ministry said. The economy grew by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter to June, faster than the 3.8 per cent growth recorded. But compared to the previous three months, the economy contracted by 0.2 per cent, reversing the 0.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.“Stronger than expected inflationary pressures and the more aggressive tightening of monetary policy in response are expected to weigh on growth in major advanced economies such as the US and Eurozone.”China, a key market for global exports, “continues to grapple with a deepening property market downturn and recurring domestic Covid-19 outbreaks”, it said.Growth in the United States is expected to slow further in the second half of the year, and “the persistent disruption in natural gas supplies from Russia could also trigger a sharp slowdown in the Eurozone economy”, it warned.Selena Ling, chief economist at OCBC Bank, said the strong recovery in the aviation and tourism sectors after Singapore lifted coronavirus restrictions should help cushion the effects of slowing global demand.\n",

      "Xinhua – South Korea’s employment kept rising for 17 straight months last month due to export growth that led to higher jobs in the manufacturing industry, statistical office data showed Wednesday.The number of those employed totalled 28,475,000 in July, up 826,000 from the same month last year, according to Statistics Korea.Jobs continued to grow for 17 months since March last year, but the year-on-year employment growth slowed after peaking at 1,135,000 in January and 1,037,000 in February.  Driven by export increase, the number of jobs among manufacturers grew 176,000 in July from a year ago, marking the highest since November 2015.Employment in the health and social welfare sector expanded by 130,000 last month, and the reading in the information and communications segment climbed by 95,000.  The number of jobs lost in the finance and insurance and the wholesale and retail segments came in at 21,000 and 10,000 respectively.The overall job growth was led by the elderly people. The number of jobs among those aged 60 or higher jumped 479,000 in July from a year earlier, and those in their 50s and 20s climbed 194,000 and 95,000 each.The number of regular employees increased by 895,000, but the readings for irregular workers and daily labourers were down 52,000 and 77,000 each last month. The number of the self-employed who hired workers picked up 78,000, and the figure for the self-employed without employees added 49,000.The employment rate for those aged 15 or higher rose 1.6 percentage points from a year earlier to 62.9 percent in July, posting the highest July figure since relevant data began to be compiled in 1982. The OECD-method hiring rate for those aged 15-64 went up 2.0 percentage points to 69.1 percent.The number of those unemployed stood at 836,000 in July, down 84,000 from a year earlier.

So far the new firm has extracted around 20 kgs of gold oreBoosting the prospects of gold production, one more gold mining firm recently started its trial operations in the country.Delcom Kampuchea, a joint venture between Cambodian and Chinese investors, started its trial operation in Preah Vihear province on August 4.The new firm has extracted around 20 kilogrammes of gold ore, said Ung Dipola, Director General of Mineral Resources at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, at a press conference recently.Delcom Kampuchea, a medium-sized company, is scheduled to produce around 340 kilogrammes of gold annually.The government is expected to receive an annual royalty income of $600,000 from Delcom Kampuchea, which received a gold exploration license in 2009.On the other hand, Renaissance Minerals (Cambodia) Ltd., a unit of Australia-listed Emerald Resources NL and the first commercial gold extraction company in Cambodia produced 3.5 tonnes of gold ore with 90 percent pure gold solution.Located in Mondulkiri province, Renaissance Minerals, after more than 14 years of exploration, started mining operations in July last year.The government also received $5.1 million in royalties from the company, which refined about 3,543 kilograms, equivalent to 232 gold bars.Cambodia, which expects to produce three tonnes of gold annually for the first eight years, looks to increase production later.When the Renaissance Minerals started extracting ore from the Okvau Gold Deposit in Mondulkiri province, Prime Minister Hun Sen said that Renaissance expects to generate gross revenues of $185 million annually within eight years of extraction.The government is expected to earn more than $40 million from tax and royalties.“This start is clearly showing that our efforts in the mining industry were indeed viable, and we can extract the underground resources to serve our social and economic development with high responsibility,” Mr Hun Sen said.As of 2021, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued gold mining licenses to seven companies in five provinces.The gold mining sites in the country are located in the provinces of Kratie, Preah Vihear, Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri and Battambang.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130766/more-and-more-young-entrepreneurs-attend-buddhas-dharma-business-workshop/\n",
      "More and more Cambodians – specially the young – recently attended a workshop on Buddha’s dharma strategies to build business partnership organised by local media firm Lotus Broadcasting Service Co Ltd (Lotus) in Chba Ampov district of Phnom Penh.The workshop at Romdoul Village Resort in Prek Thmey quarter had presentations by a prominent Cambodian economist and other well-known Cambodian entrepreneurs to about 50 participants, mostly young entrepreneurs and professionals.Mey Kalyan, senior advisor of the Supreme National Economic Council (SNEC), told Khmer Times on the sidelines of the workshop that he has noticed more and more people, especially young entrepreneurs and professionals coming to attend the workshop, which is a remarkable trend.“Today, I have seen that there are more people coming, especially the younger generation. It is very good that they are interested more and more and I want to see this continuing,” Kalyan said. Participants are mostly owners of businesses in agriculture machinery, real estate, money exchange, rice sale, silk, pharmacy and publishing.Ieng Sotheara, a prominent Cambodian businessman who practised Buddha dharma in his businesses in real estate development, hospitality and media, was one of the speakers at the workshop. Sotheara is also the president of Cambodia-Japan Association for Business and Investment (CJBI).Sotheara said Buddha’s dharma teaches both entrepreneurs and people to practice indication of business partnership through good friendship, which consists of four main indicators for them to examine before entering to any partnership agreements and they include faith or generosity, noble precept, contribution and intelligence.Entrepreneurs should also assess the current status of their business partnership they are being in through looking into models that include one plus one equal minus, one plus one equal zero, one plus one equal two or one plus one equal greater than two and then compare them with the Buddha’s dharma principle of business partnership, he explained.“You have to examine action, speech and heart of any person who you want to partner with in business, which means whether they do what they say and whether they have intelligence, not just looking at potentials of the company such as much money or good information. They should think beforehand about a way of exit in case of any problem within the partnership,” Sotheara explained.“In terms of noble precept, you need to figure out whether that person knows good deed and bad deed. For example, your concept is that you do not want to do business that is against laws, social morality or contribution, but that person does not care about these things, but focusing only on earning money and taking advantage on agreement,” he added.Sotheara added that the young generations should understand that Buddha’s dharma not only teach people to be prepared for next life, but also to live current life better such as how to use the techniques to become wealthy, healthy and happy in family. “That’s why we all need to explain them to understand these principles or concepts better,” Sothear responded to a question raised by a young man. \n",

      "AFP – Asian markets rallied Thursday as investors breathed a sigh of relief after data showed US inflation finally easing from a four-decade high, giving the Federal Reserve some room to slow down its pace of interest rate hikes.The below-forecast reading on consumer prices came on the back of a sharp drop in energy costs and provided a much-needed boost to risk assets across the board.Wall Street enjoyed a surge that saw the Nasdaq pile on more than two percent and push it into a technical bull market – having spiked more than 20 percent from its June lows – while the dollar dropped against its peers.And Treasury yields – a gauge of future interest rates – dropped.Trading floors had been nervous going into Wednesday’s release, as many had feared a forecast-topping figure would beef up pressure on the Fed to announce another bumper rate hike at its September meeting.Fears that the bank’s monetary tightening drive would send the world’s top economy into recession have dragged markets lower for months, with the mood already darkened by several issues including the Ukraine war, supply chain snarls and worsening China-US relations.The positive energy from New York filtered through to Asia, where Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei and Manila all rose more than one percent, while Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta were also well up.But while sentiment was positive, analysts warned against getting over-excited as inflation was still high and would take some time to get under control.“We still need to see a couple more monthly decreases in underlying inflation before the (Fed) can start to think about pausing its tightening cycle,” Carol Kong, of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg Television.“The market is still currently underestimating US inflation and how sticky it will be over the medium term.”Meanwhile, Fed officials were out trying to temper expectations that they might start reducing borrowing costs as soon as next year.Minneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari warned “we are a long way away from saying that we’re anywhere close to declaring victory”, while Chicago bank boss Charles Evans added rates would continue to rise for “the rest of this year and into next year”.Investors will be hanging on further comments from policymakers over the next weeks for an idea about the pace of rate hikes, with a still-strong jobs growth showing the economy remained resilient despite higher borrowing costs and inflation.“Inflation has been expected to peak over the summer for some time, so it was reassuring for markets that there are clear signs that this looks to be happening,” said Oliver Blackbourn, of Janus Henderson Investors.“However, the Fed will doubtless be focused on the signs about underlying inflation, particularly against a very tight-looking labour market.”And Christian Hoffmann, at Thornburg Investment Management, added: “We should not be surprised to see Fed speakers continue to try to talk down the market and risk assets.”Oil prices edged down as demand expectations continued to be sapped by worries about a recession, with both main contracts around six-month lows and below their pre-Ukraine war levels.The selling was also being fed by data showing US stockpiles at their highest levels since December thanks to a pick-up in domestic output, while some flows to three European countries from Russia resumed after a payment dispute linked to sanctions was resolved.\n",

      "The Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC) on Wednesday expressed concern over a decline in purchase orders from Western countries for the second half of 2022.GMAC Secretary-General Ken Loo said the unstable global situation and the likeliness of an economic downturn mainly in Western countries have raised “serious concern over the export situation for the second half of the year.”“Many members have informed the GMAC of the reduced /revised order situation and some have sought legal advice from GMAC legal team on the procedure for a possible partial production suspension,” he said in a news release.“The GMAC is conducting an extensive survey among all members to analyze the order situation more accurately,” he added.Amid this serious concern, Cambodia is going through a huge jump in labor-related costs after the government announced the implementation of pension fund contribution and annual minimum wage revision to take effect in January, he said.“This double cost increase is serious enough to be worried, not to mention other issues like higher logistics cost and higher cost of compliance which is increasing every year due to buyers’ demand,” Loo said.Looking forward, he suggested that Cambodia need to be proactive and cautious about things that would put more cost pressure on the companies.The garment, footwear and travel goods industry is the largest foreign exchange earner for Cambodia. The sector consists of roughly 1,100 factories and branches, employing approximately 750,000 workers, mostly female.According to the General Department of Customs and Excise, the Southeast Asian nation exported products totally worth $6.6 billion during the first half of this year, up 40 percent from $4.72 billion over the same period last year.

      "The percentage of petroleum station owners complying with the legal requirements to run their oil and gas stations has soared to 73 percent early this month, according to a senior official at the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). The increase followed after the petroleum law was enacted in 2018.The law on the management of petroleum and petroleum products was adopted by Cambodia’s National Assembly in mid-July 2019 to regulate the downstream activities of the country’s petroleum sector requires that owners of petroleum and gas stations set up standardized technical and safety management on the premises.Nearly 570 or 15 percent of 3,778 owners of oil and gas stations submitted applications for certificates and permits to MME in 2018 and over 3,400 or 67 percent of\n",
      "over 5,000 in 2021, according to a five-year achievement report of the government.MME has issued 63 licenses and 17 permits for commercial operations for oil and gas that include inventory centres, importing, transportation, supplying, distributing and packaging for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021, according to the report, adding that the ministry has provided 344 certificates of technical fulfilment and 1,931 permits for operations for oil and gas stations during the period.Cheap Sour, director general of general department of petroleum of MME, said during a press conference that mostly franchised petroleum and gas stations have been facing technical and safety standard issues, while stations run by companies such as Kampuchea Tela, Sokimex Investment Group, Chevron (Cambodia) Limited, TotalEnergies, etc. follow the law and regulations well.“After we have conducted raising awareness, education and training, we have seen more and more people understand the requirements and so they have come to apply for license to improve their technical and safety standards in running their stations,” said Sour, who did not mention the number of licenses, permits and certificates.Sour, who is also the spokesman of the ministry, added that owners of petroleum and gas stations in Cambodia need to follow standards and requirements set by the law and regulations by improving their assembly equipment such as pump topper, petrol tanks and turbine pumps.Preap Deta, general manager at PRN4 Tela Gas Station along National Road 4 in Ang Snuol district of Kandal province, told Khmer Times that the owners of the stations have fulfilled all requirements set by the MME and he was assigned to attend training on standards and safety at the provincial hall and officials have visited the station.However, Deta said that the current economic condition has been unfavourable for oil and gas stations to implement the requirements, especially improvement as the price of oil has not been stable and the companies sometimes did not have sufficient products to supply to the stations, while the government set prices for sale that do not enable us to gain profit.“Logically, we do business to make profit, but the economic situation is like this, mostly we cannot make it, but loss, especially those who rent premises and hire staff. That’s why I think to improve the stations as per legal requirements is most likely impossible because we need money to spend on improvement,” said Deta.He went on the add that some of the oil and gas station owners he knows have suspended operations and some are in plan as they have received losses every month, while customers have reduced consumption remarkably such as drivers of cars, tuk-tuks and motorbikes as they have generated less and less income.“Currently, they do not refill the tanks fully and they do not refill often like before. So, now, surviving is the best. An improvement would depend on the economic situation, especially since income has gone down and businesses have been shut down. Despite the recovery, mostly people use income that has just recovered to cover most necessary stuff. No need to talk about improvement yet,” he said.\n",

      "Cambodia’s travel goods export to the US has increased by 59.5 percent in the first half of this year though the General Specialized Preference (GSP), which offers trade preference to the Kingdom’s travel goods, has not yet been renewed by the country.Figures from the Cambodia Travel Goods and Leather Association showed that the export of bags and travel goods to the US amounted to $802 million in the January-June period this year, compared to the same period last year.The US is the biggest market for Cambodia’s bags and travel goods, said association’s honorary president Ly Kunthai.Cambodia’s travel and bag products have only received GSP status in the US market since 2016 and other products such as clothes and footwear are exported to the US under the Most-Favoured Nation status, which allows for discounts on imports.The GSP status, offered to Less Developing Countries by the US, expired last December and the US government is in the process of reactivating the status.Cambodia’s bags and travel goods are increasingly absorbed by the US market and expected to grow further, Kunthai said.In the first half of 2021, garment, footwear, and travel goods exports from Cambodia amounted to $6,561 million, a 39 percent increase year-on-year, according to a report by the General Department of Customs and Excise.The US remains the largest market for Cambodian exports with $4.64 billion in the first semester this year, up 54 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.Penn Sovicheat, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Commerce, said that the GSP scheme has contributed to the growth in travel goods export to the US and bilateral trade.“Cambodia’s exports to the US under the GSP scheme are taxed between 12 percent and 19 percent,” Sovicheat said, adding that the GSP had contributed to an increase in the two-way trade between the two countries.\n",

Expanding international market access for local SMEs is one of Khmer Enterprise’s strategic initiatives to align with the Royal Government of Cambodia’s post-Covid-19 economic recovery.”The EMDG programme helps SMEs to lower the cost of export development and also allows them to invest more in export promotion activities, the release said.With the feedback from SMEs in Cohort 1, EMDG Cohort 2 is designed to provide further benefits to SMEs to develop their export markets, new or existing ones, with a more simplified and streamlined application process.The EMDG Cohort 2 reimburses up to 50% of eligible expenses relating to the export market development plan. With a forward-looking approach, SMEs can plan their future promotional activities and build their export markets with greater certainty and confidence, the release said.The development of international markets and export promotion activities are crucial for SMEs to increase their exports yet many of these activities have been disrupted due to the COVID19 pandemic.

      "Investors from Thailand are mulling options to set up joint investments in Cambodia in some sectors, including processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, services, gems and jewellery.Around 60 businesspeople from Thailand visited Cambodia last week and the delegation held a discussion with the Minister of Industry Cham Prasidh.The business delegation termed its visit as a move to further enhance the business, trade and investment cooperation between both countries.Many investors from Thailand are looking at Cambodia’s potential for an export-orientated manufacturing base, considering that the Kingdom had entered into several free-trade agreements with several countries, including China and South Korea.According to experts, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) have provided wider exporting markets for the Kingdom. Cambodia’s total export to other RCEP member countries totalled $3.28 billion in the first half of 2022, up 10 percent year-on-year.Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, led the delegation to Cambodia in the first week of August.Angubolkul was quoted as saying in a Bangkok Post report that the delegation urged the government in Cambodia to help tackle obstacles to trade facilitation, in terms of rules and redundant regulations, to attract more foreign investment.Angubolkul pointed out that Cambodia has been witnessing an average annual economic growth of 7-8 percent because of the country’s foreign direct investment policy.Reiterating that the Kingdom has been looking at developing its tourism and agricultural sectors, he told the Bangkok newspaper, “This offers a very good opportunity for Thai businesses to forge joint investments with Cambodian counterparts in many sectors such as processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, the service sector, as well as gems and jewellery.”The delegation also proposed that the Thai government re-establish a rail link between Sa Kaeo’s Aranyaprathet district and Cambodia’s Poi Pet to facilitate cross-border trade and boost tourism around Thailand’s eastern border, according to the report.The rail link was halted following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.The bilateral trade between both countries surged around 23 percent to $2.297 billion in the first half of this year compared with $1.870 billion in the previous year, according to the data from the General Department of Customs and Excise.Exports to Thailand rose 36.7 per cent to $495.778 million while imports went up 19.5 per cent to $1.801 billion. However, Cambodia’s trade deficit with Thailand rose 14 percent to $1.306 billion during the period.Cambodia’s main exports to Thailand include textiles, agricultural products, gems, raw materials and semi-finished products.Major imports from Thailand are fish, meat, vegetables, automobiles, organic fertilisers, foodstuffs, and construction materials. \n",

      "The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has said its projects are designed in line with the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries’ 2030 Agriculture Master Plan.The Master Plan is focussed on realising high-quality productive capacity and increasing the smallholder rural farmer productivity along with an increase in farmers’ income.It said the size of the IFAD country portfolio currently stands at $411 million and will grow to $775 million in the next five years to support the rural agriculture value chains in Cambodia.Following the impact surveys from different projects, it has been confirmed that the programme is able to increase smallholders’ returns by 25 percent in general.In response to the IFAD Country Program Strategy Evaluation, it was recognised that developing the rural economy is contingent on diverse interrelated conditions and factors that cannot be mitigated through one project.Following considerable opportunities for leveraging and building synergies among and between IFAD financed projects as well as those of other bilateral and multilateral financing and donor agencies, the programmatic approach to enhance the impact of investments on agriculture value chains for smallholders was adopted in 2019, it said.Based on the strong foundation, new pillars such as water investment and value chain financing, are being put in place. Under the pipeline projects, IFAD and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank are designing a $220 million investment project to support water investment through MoWRAM.Meng Sakphouseth, the Country Program Officer said that at a design level, the programmatic approach focuses on creating and strengthening synergies at the economic pole level through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms in which a diverse range of value chain stakeholders participate in order to define the interventions necessary to support and strengthen value chains.He further said, “At the project level, Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB’s) focusing on market linkages, production and value chains are collaboratively planned across projects.. and at the national level .. through a country program steering committee where all the projects meet to review progress, ensure more effective planning and holistic support targeted at rural communities through the alignment of production, marketing, as well as infrastructure support.”Sakphouseth added: “Most importantly at a beneficiary level, the practical developmental outcomes of this approach can enable rural people to obtain increased, sustainable incomes from market-led farming and from decent  remunerative employment.”The overall support results in the increase in the productive capacity of farmers by helping them get access to productive assets and skills, secondly, an increase in market efficiency through the aggregation of producers in agriculture cooperatives linked to value chains with growth potential and also an increase of sustainability, and reducing vulnerability to shocks by mainstreaming climate and environmental concerns, he said.A mechanism to ensure the full and timely exchange of information, constant program monitoring and evaluation and the consequent early and prompt addressing of technical matters across the projects, in line with the programmatic approach, has also been recently established in the form of a quarterly Technical Co-ordination Meeting (TCM), which is chaired on a rotating basis.\n",

On July 26 this year, the greenback reached 112 taka in the country’s open market for the first time. Subsequently, the rate hovered around 106 taka at the kerb market as authorities launched raids on money exchanger houses and the Bangladesh Bank (BB) intensified its monitoring.However, the fresh hike comes amid mounting economic pressure and speculation that the country is in dire need of foreign loan support.Increasing imports and a widening trade deficit were also cited as the possible reasons for taka depreciation.A BB official told Xinhua that the import bill in the last fiscal year 2021-22 increased to over 82 billion US dollars, fueling a persistent increase in the country’s trade deficit.“This is continuously increasing the pressure on the taka,” said the official who did not like to be named.Bangladesh’s trade deficit ballooned to a record level of over 33 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2021-22 which ended June 30 on the back of increased imports, showed the latest central bank data.According to the central bank data, the country’s import payment was 82.50 billion dollars, up 35.95 percent, in the last fiscal year, while earnings from exports stood at 49.25 billion dollars, up 33.45 percent, during the same period.Experts here in recent months have stressed the need for curbing imports, boosting exports and inflow of remittances to minimize trade deficit and provide relief to the country’s forex reserves. Weighed by higher import bills and the taka’s weakness driven by the dollar’s broad surge in recent months, Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserves last month fell below 40 billion dollars for the first time in two years.In its bid to boost the shrinking forex reserves, the BB has recently taken measures to discourage imports and woo more remittances from millions of Bangladeshi people living and working abroad.The Bangladeshi government last Thursday said it is contemplating taking loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as precautionary measures.Ahmad Kaikaus, principal secretary to the Bangladeshi prime minister, said the government did not seek a bailout, rather it is thinking of taking pragmatic steps in advance to address the upcoming or uncertain situation of the country due to the adverse impacts of the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.However, the concerned authorities such as the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Relations Division are holding discussions with the WB and ADB to take precautionary measures if the war continues, he continued. Replying to a query if  Bangladesh is taking loans like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he said the country’s statistics indicate that Bangladesh does not need loans as it has sufficient foreign reserves.\n",

      "Experts see inflation reprieve in America\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129994/experts-see-inflation-reprieve-in-america/\n",
      "AFP – Is inflation finally slowing down in the United States?Inflation data due to be released Wednesday is expected to show at least a partial cooling down of consumer prices and bring a breath of fresh air for US President Joe Biden just months before crucial midterm elections.Fueled by aggressive consumer spending of pandemic savings, global supply chain snarls, domestic worker shortages, and Russia’s war on Ukraine, inflation reached 9.1 percent in June, year over year, the highest in 40 years.But it is expected to fall to 8.6 percent in July, according to MarketWatch.White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said that although the administration has not seen the fresh statistics yet, “We know that gas prices have fallen.”“And we hope those gas price declines will factor into the CPI inflation data,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.Consumer prices have continued to climb in the United States, squeezing family budgets and, and by extension, Biden’s popularity.His opponents accuse Biden of precipitating inflation with his gigantic $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which he enacted in March last year, shortly after assuming office.And Republicans renewed their criticism of Biden’s economic policy, saying Sunday’s passage in the Senate of his massive climate and healthcare bill titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” does the opposite of its stated purpose.Larger issueBut the devil is in the details.Experts worry that the inflation slowdown linked to the drop in gasoline prices could be outweighed by rising rent and real estate prices.“The larger issue is what happens to home ownership costs & rents,” Diane Swonk, chief economist for KPMG, wrote on Twitter.Similar to other economists, Swonk expects to see a rise in the so-called underlying inflation rate that excludes food and energy, which had risen to 5.9 percent in June, year over year.The question now facing Washington is whether it will be possible to bring inflation down sustainably, without plunging the world’s largest economy into recession, after two quarters of economic contraction.In a bid to tamp down inflation, the US Federal Reserve has already hiked the interest rate four times to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent.On the bright side, the US labor market remains dynamic and in July the unemployment rate fell to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent.But there are still nearly two jobs open for every available worker, which pushes wages up and contributes to inflation.Inflation data will be released Wednesday at 8:30am local time (1230 GMT).\n",

      "A new collaboration programme on science, technology, and innovation (STI) is being developed, featuring Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam.The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said it was supporting the development of a new collaboration programme on science, technology, and innovation (STI) among the four South East Asian nations.This initiative is expected to establish a mutually beneficial partnership to tackle common challenges and opportunities for building scientific know-how, technological capabilities and innovation breakthroughs among the four countries.To fulfil the promise of STI to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, countries need concerted efforts to unlock the potential of scientific knowledge, digital technologies and business innovations, a ESCAP release said.ESCAP pointed out that the programme would identify specific areas, resources and institutional commitments to support strategic cooperation between the collaborating countries on STI.“STI cooperation and collaboration between neighbouring countries is essential if we wish to address collective challenges in the context of sustainable development,” said Kieth Rethy Chhem, Minister Delegate attached to Prime Minister and Secretary of State, Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation of Cambodia.Explaining the significance of the programme, Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, said, “To achieve the ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals, countries need to leverage science, technology and innovation. By facilitating south-south and triangular collaboration in this area, we hope to boost national innovation capabilities, tackle high-priority societal challenges and nurture shared prosperity.”Talking about Thailand’s Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model, Kitipong Promwong, President, Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO) of Thailand, said, “The government of Thailand has launched Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model or BCG as a new economic model aiming to promote inclusive and sustainable development on both national and regional scales. This collaboration programme will support our people and planet by amplifying the use of technological solutions and scientific knowledge for more sustainable economic models.”This initiative, adding to the Asia-Pacific Research and Training Network on STI Policy (ARTNETonSTI), will draw on a community of practice of government officials and policy experts to design forward-looking and evidence-based science, technology and innovation policies for inclusive and sustainable development, the release added. \n",

      "The ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’ project by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is set to boost job prospects in the agriculture sector.The agency, which launched the ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’ in the Kingdom recently, expects that the project would help create more than 3,000 jobs over a period of five years.USAID anticipates that the project would help generate $38 million in new private sector investments, help agriculture businesses and producers access $15 million in agriculture-related financing, and generate $100 million in sales.Veng Sakhon, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and US Ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy officially launched the new $25 million project on Monday.The project aims to promote sustainable, broad-based economic growth by increasing diversification and competitiveness in Cambodia’s agriculture sector.USAID said in a release that Harvest III is a five-year activity, funded by the US government’s Feed the Future initiative.“The US government has invested nearly $100 million over the past decade to improve both nutrition and family incomes in Cambodia by strengthening the country’s agriculture sector,” Murphy said in a statement.“In this global food crisis, it is critical that Cambodia strengthen its food security and Harvest III reflects the US government’s commitment towards this goal,” he added.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the project during his visit to Cambodia last week.USAID Harvest III would work with agriculture cooperatives, technology providers, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to develop a skilled workforce, create jobs, and capture market opportunities in the agriculture sector by working with the private sector.The project is expected to build on investments that USAID/Cambodia has already made promoting sustainable economic opportunities and climate-smart agriculture technologies. By collaborating with companies working in agricultural markets, the project intents to help improve livelihoods for Cambodians, especially women, youth, and marginalised populations, it pointed out.While announcing the project on August 4, Blinken said, “We believe in this programme, we believe in our partners, and we want to do much more good work together. It’s critical that we strengthen global food security and address the root causes of hunger, malnutrition, and poverty.”Since 2010, US agricultural investments in Cambodia through the USAID-led Feed the Future Initiative have helped 200,000 farmers increase their production and sales of fruits, vegetables, rice, and fish, and contributed to a 10 percent reduction in childhood stunting over the last eight years through improved, diversified diets, according to a report.The Kingdom’s agricultural exports surged 63.83 percent to 7,984,251.83 tonnes in 2021, from 3,110,790.73 tonnes in 2020.The country also generated revenue of $4,967,852,713, from exports last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture’s National Phytosanitary Database.The agricultural exports also reached 68 unique countries and territories in 2021 and the major products were milled and paddy rice, peppercorn, mangoes, bananas, cassava, corn and other vegetables.\n",

      "Thai businesses have set their sights on expanding trade and investment in Cambodia, especially in processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, and gems and jewellery.Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC), said Cambodia is seeing average economic growth of 7 – 8% per year as a result of the country opening up to foreign direct investment.Cambodia has been trying to develop its tourism and agricultural sectors, but the country still lacks sufficient knowledge and modern technology, especially in terms of storage and processing in order to increase values.This offers a very good opportunity for Thai businesses to forge joint investments with Cambodian counterparts in many sectors as above, according to Sanan, who is also chairman of the Board of Trade of Thailand. He led the first post-pandemic visit to Cambodia by more than 60 Thai businesses on August 4 – 5.The Thai business delegations also met with Cambodia’s Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Cham Prasidh. They urged the Cambodian government to help tackle obstacles to trade facilitation, in terms of rules and redundant regulations, to attract more foreign investment.Sanan said Cambodia is potentially capable of becoming an export-orientated manufacturing base for Thai investors now that the country has free-trade agreements with several countries, including China and the Republic of Korea.He added that the Thai business sector has also proposed that cooperation be focused on gems and jewellery, as well as education.According to Sanan, the business group also proposed that the Thai government re-establish a rail link between Sa Kaeo’s Aranyaprathet district and Cambodia’s Poi Pet to facilitate cross-border trade and boost tourism around Thailand’s eastern border.The rail link was halted following the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020.Two-way trade between Thailand and Cambodia totalled 7.97 billion USD in 2021, up 10.2% from a year before.Exports from Thailand accounted for 7.07 billion USD, and imports stood at 895 million USD.

      "Cambodia will generate its first revenue of about $18 million by selling nearly 3,000 barrels of crude oil to a Singaporean firm if the government approves the latest results of the negotiations between Cambodian officials, the shipment company and the buying firm, according to a senior official of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).Recently, Cambodian officials, World Tank, owner of MT-Strovolors and Singaporean oil buyer Trafigura have reached a consensus to bring back the oil Cambodia ‘lost’ last year, the official said.Meng Saktheara, secretary of state of MME, told Khmer Times yesterday that Trafigura had examined the quantity and quality of the oil stored on MT-Strovolors currently in Thailand after it was purchased from bankrupt KristEnergy that did not pay the shipment fee to World Tank.“The agency has already confirmed that there is no loss of quantity and quality of oil as the ship has maintained the oil very well,” said Saktheara, who is also the head of Block A Project Implementation.Saktheara said during a press conference that the oil was lost not due to corruption or collusion among government officials. “KrisEnergy had hired MT-Strovolors to store the oil, but the former breached the agreement by not paying the shipment fees so the latter needed to exercise its rights by keeping the oil till the payment is made.”“We expect that we will prepare a detailed agreement to be signed soon and conduct the negotiations. If Prime Minister Hun Sen agrees to the results, we will sign it shortly and bring the oil back and sell it,” said SakthearaKristEnergy was bankrupt when it hired MT-Strovolors to store the oil and ship it out of Block A of Cambodia. As the former was unable to pay shipment fees, the latter took the oil out seeking settlement of the fee.World Tank then cited weather conditions as an excuse to take the anchor off and set the ship on sail at night.At about 9 am the next day, captain of KristEnergy who stood by at the oil well platform informed Cambodian officials that the ship left secretly. The government then asked the navy to get the ship back, but it was too late as the ship had already entered Thailand waters.Later it left for Indonesia and Bangladesh as well despite the best efforts of Cambodia to bring the ship back.“Even though we tried legal ways to get the ship back, we failed. But we continued the efforts through negotiations based on international laws,” Saktheara said.\n",

      "Cambodia slipped one rank in the latest Nikkei Global Covid-19 Recovery Index but held the second rank as the country’s economy continues to bounce back vigorously from the clutches of the pandemic.With 78 points, the Middle East nation Bahrain now tops the index for July and Cambodia is just behind with 77.5 points. The index having 121 countries lists eastern Caribbean island Barbados at the last with just 39 points.Cambodia was ranked first in the index last June, following a wide array of measures adopted by the country to beat Covid-19, including the massive vaccination campaigns and the early reopening of the economy.At the last count by July end, Cambodia vaccinated 15,116,378 (at least one dose) of its estimated 16 million people since the vaccination campaign began on February 10, 2021, covering 94.48 percent of the population so far.The Kingdom is also among the first in the region to reopen for business with its widely acclaimed ‘Live with Covid-19’ policy. The country had ended most of its Covid-19 restrictions as early as November 2021 and a majority of the businesses reopened then.The Nikkei index assesses countries and regions on infection management, vaccine rollouts and social mobility. The higher the ranking, the closer an area is to recovery, characterized by lower infection and death rates and better inoculation coverage, as well as fewer movement restrictions.Data sources for the index included Our World in Data, Google Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports, Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, flight data firm Cirium and Nikkei Asia research.Meanwhile, some of the Asian giants had massive fall this time compared to the June index with Japan plunging 60 places to 90th, as the omicron subvariant BA.5 is spreading in the country with more daily cases than anywhere else in the world.South Korea, also reporting a jump in infections, slipped to 13th from fourth on the Nikke’s index. In the Asia-Pacific region, apart from Cambodia, Vietnam too continued to rank high at fourth. Taiwan rose 33 spots, with cases and deaths falling, and is positioned at 79th rank now.Bahrain’s government attributed its top ranking to its successful Covid-19 mitigation efforts, including the increase in vaccination rollout and full adherence to health precautionary measures.Globally, Japan, the United States and South Korea reported the most Covid-19 cases in the last week of July, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Japan saw 1.38 million infections, a 42 percent increase from the previous week, while South Korea reported more than 560,000, up 25 percent, for the same period.In Japan, government experts attributed the latest wave in the infections to the highly contagious yet less deadly BA.5 subvariant. Over 63 percent of Japanese have been triple vaccinated and 30 percent of those aged 60 or above have received a fourth shot.BA.5 is now the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, with a prevalence rate of 69.6 percent, according to the WHO.Meanwhile, Cambodia reported 25 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, bringing the total cases to 137,081. No deaths were reported, keeping the total to 3,056 direct deaths from Covid-19 in the country. There were 54 recoveries recorded.There are now 264 active Covid-19 cases in the Kingdom.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129066/kingdom-received-over-240000-tourists-last-weekend/\n",
      "Showing signs of revival in tourism, the number of national and international visitors travelled across the country in the first weekend of this month rose to 246,195.The figures showed an 11.43 percent increase in the number of visitors in the first week of August, compared to more than 220,000 tourists received in the last weekend of July, according to the Ministry of Tourism.Interestingly, 224,993 were national visitors and 21,202 were internal foreign tourists during the first weekend of this month.The number of visitors rose because Cambodia successfully hosted the 55th Asean Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and other related events in the country last week. Many of the ministers and delegation used the occasion to visit some of the popular tourist destinations in the country.Siem Reap again emerged as the top spot for visitors due to the interest among the tourists to visit the world-famous Angkor Wat.The other places of interest for tourists during the last week were the provinces of Preah Sihanouk, Kampot, Kep, Battambang, and the capital Phnom Penh.While Siem Reap received 39,979 tourists, Preah Sihanouk attracted 33,837 visitors, followed by Kampot (33,461), Kep (20,057), and Battambang (19,688) from August 6 to August 7.Phnom Penh remained one of the top destinations in the country with the capital attracting 18,734 tourists during the weekend.While Kampong Speu received 12,199 travellers during the period, Pursat and Kandal attracted 11,999 and 11,085 tourists, respectively.The Kingdom expects to attract one million international tourists this year, tourism minister Thong Khon said last month.The country received 510,000 foreign visitors in the first half of this year, a whooping increase of 394 percent compared to the same period last year.Vietnam and Thailand were the largest sources of tourists to the country.“We hope to attract around one million foreign tourists in 2022 and up to two million in 2023,” Khon said.Tourism, one of the four pillars supporting the Kingdom’s economy, is forecast to reach its pre-Covid level in 2026 or 2027.In the pre-pandemic era, Cambodia received 6.6 million international tourists in 2019, generating $4.92 billion in revenue.Cambodia was also one of the first countries in Asean that had reopened its borders and eased travel restrictions for international travellers.The Ministry of Tourism and the provincial and municipal tourism departments continued to enforce safety standard operating procedures to prevent the possible transmission of Covid-19, a statement said.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129255/covid-19-gambling-ban-leave-sville-biz-sulking/\n",
      "Covid-19 and the ban on online gambling have left several businesses in Cambodia’s coastal city Sihanoukville sulking with over 1,500 multi-million building projects reportedly abandoned midway by investors.The city had a thriving gambling business from 2015 to 2019, but the government suddenly clamped a ban on it in August 2019, forcing many of the investors in the business to leave the country.The ban was followed by Covid-19, leading to the further flight of Chinese investors, sources in the real estate sector told Khmer Times.Seeking a solution to their grievances, several developers reportedly met with provincial government officials in early July, with the hope the authorities will provide tax relief and create a land-value index to help with lease negotiations.They had also sought the government’s help to resolve disputes with landlords by persuading the latter to become stakeholders in the projects.In recent weeks, the city also witnessed a couple of violent crimes forcing the provincial governor Kuoch Chamroeun to warn that in the event of shootings, abductions, drug use and other crimes at casinos and other businesses, strict measures will be enforced including shutting down the establishment.He warned that provincial authorities would not only shut down the business but also ask the government to revoke the business licence.Some residents, meanwhile, are of the view that Sihanoukville’s fortunes began to change on June 22, 2019 after a construction site collapse that left 28 workers dead and 26 injured.Meanwhile, the government is all the more determined to develop Sihanoukville as a model city and is in the process of completing an ambitious masterplan to turn the city into a commercial and logistics hub, besides a tourism hotspot.Edward Lee, CEO of Prince Real Estate, told Khmer Times that the issue in Sihanoukville now was not about investors leaving but more about not able to come back yet as quite a number of those projects are owned by investors from China and China has still not fully reopened due to its ‘Zero Covid-19’ policy.“For the last three years, due to Covid, many projects have been temporarily stopped in Sihanoukville, but some will be reactivated for sure. Overall, Cambodia’s real estate sector is recovering faster than its neighbours,” he said.Lor Vichet, Phnom Penh President of Global Real Estate Association said Sihanoukville was chosen for gambling business by some Philippine investors too after the former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte took a tough stance against the practice.“In Cambodia, licences were easy to get to start casinos and some of them took advantage of it,” he said, adding that real estate prices too suddenly rose in the city. “But after the ban on online gambling by Cambodian government, these businesses left the country,” he noted, leaving the unfinished constructions as well.But Tom O’Sullivan, CEO of realestate.com.kh felt that it is not all that bad in Sihanoukville. “The authorities need time to clean up some of the mess left by these gamblers,” he said. \n",

      "Despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bilateral trade between Cambodia and Thailand showed significant growth in the last three years.During a courtesy meeting between the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Business Commission last week, commerce minister Pan Sorasak urged Thai investors in Cambodia to become more active in promoting trade and investment.Chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce Sanan Angubolkul said, “The purpose of the Thai Chamber of Commerce delegation’s current visit was to increase trade opportunities and expand the market network through high-quality trade fairs, especially in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). In addition, this trade visit and trade fair play an important role in connecting with business partners in Cambodia, such as the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce as well as trade associations to invite Cambodian-Thai businessmen to meet in order to strengthen and expand trade relations as well as increase trade volume between Cambodia and Thailand.”Lim Heng, Vice President of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce (CCC), said that the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Chamber of Commerce have been working closely to promote business matching between the two countries to ensure the flow of business and investment.  This meeting will also include business matching between the two countries, which will bring mutual benefits for both parties.He also encouraged all traders and investors to actively participate and find more of their investment partners for mutual benefit and to achieve fruitful results in the future.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce also asked the chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce to help promote some important business activities, including the Organize Cambodia-Thailand trade mission. Moreover, they should participate in the Cambodia Expo, which is held annually in Phnom Penh and organised by the Ministry of Commerce of Cambodia; and participate in business forums to strengthen trade and investment relations between Cambodia and Thailand.Bilateral trade between Cambodia and Thailand rose 22.8 percent to $2.297 billion in the first half of 2022 from $1.870 billion a year ago, according to the General Department of Customs and Excise. Exports to Thailand grew 36.7 per cent year-on-year to $495.778 million while imports climbed 19.5 per cent to $1.801 billion. Meanwhile, Cambodia’s trade deficit with Thailand for the January-June period stood at $1.306 billion, expanding by 14 per cent on a yearly basis.\n",

      "Cambodia’s largest local commercial bank Acleda Bank Plc continued the operations of its subsidiaries Acleda Bank Lao Ltd (ABL) and Acleda MFI Myanmar Co Ltd (AMM) in June this year even as they are confronted by some pressing economic, political and pandemic environment challenges, according to the bank’s report.Lao PDR’s inflation increased from under 2 percent in February 2021 to 9.9 percent in April 2022 and threatened living standards, especially in low-income urban households. The fiscal deficit declined in 2021, driven by higher domestic revenue and spending curbs despite domestic revenue rebounding to 12.4 percent of GDP in 2021 as it has remained below pre-pandemic levels and the regional average.As the Lao economy began its recovery from the effects of the worldwide slowdown caused by COVID-19, the country faced challenges caused by long-standing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including rising global commodity prices and sharp exchange rate depreciation, the report added.High debt-service obligations and low revenue levels continued to limit the fiscal space for critical investment in human capital. Public debt levels have increased considerably since 2019, endangering macroeconomic stability, the report read, adding that policy options were available to mitigate these threats.“The government has pledged to take stronger action to manage currency exchange rates and address fuel shortage and debts owed to private companies and foreign countries. The pledge is part of the government’s continuing efforts to fulfil the goals of the two national agendas, which seek to ease the country’s economic and financial difficulties and curb drug trafficking,” the report pointed out.“Raising the reserve requirement means that the central bank can reduce money supply, which should enable it to better control money supply and curb inflation, as well as respond to the nation’s economic woes,” the report stated, adding that as at 30 June 2022, Covid-19 outbreak since the last 3 years has been much recovered.“During the last serious outbreak, most clients of the bank requested to delay payment and can pay some amount of monthly loan repayment… therefore, ABL has set strategy for solving loan default and action plan to improve the quality of loan portfolio,” the report said.As of 30 June 22, the exchange rate still fluctuated and impacted the ABL performance, but in terms of Lao Kip currency, loan outstanding is still over plan around 1 percent. Loan default has 7.24 percent decrease compared to March 22 due to the collection rate increased. So far, ABL still has the ability to pay its debt, and liquidity and cash flow are still in a good position.Myanmar’s economy and people are undergoing the impact of the political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic cases since 2021. These protests and movements caused temporary disruptions in the business operations across Myanmar including other key services including electricity, logistics and digital connectivity and led to much fluctuation in exchange rate.Until this June 2022, due to the vaccination enforcement, protective and preventive measures against the COVID-19 from government and the people, the COVID-19 cases in Myanmar have drastically declined, and to develop tourism sector and facilitate the entries of foreigners, the government lifted the ban on foreign visitors with few public health requirements by allowing international passenger flights to operate as normal after suspension for over two years.As at 30 June 2022, some business activities have started resuming operations including the local and international trade imports and exports, the manufacturing sector output and employment also appeared to be stabilising, and exports have recovered in recent months.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128682/solid-ties-with-china-bring-great-benefits-to-cambodia/\n",
      "The solid relationship with China has provided great benefits to Cambodia’s socio-economic development and poverty reduction, a Cambodian academic said on Monday.Senior economist Ky Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said China is the largest donor, investor and trading partner of Cambodia, and that the ties between the two countries are currently “as solid as the Great Wall of China.”“Chinese aid and investment have played a very important role in supporting Cambodia’s socio-economic development and poverty reduction through creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” he told Xinhua.Sereyvath said under the Belt and Road Initiative, China has helped build many mega-projects such as roads, bridges, ports, airports, hydropower plants, economic zones, and a national stadium in the Southeast Asian nation.The expert noted three remarkable Chinese invested projects in Cambodia, namely the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, the first ever Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville expressway, and the new Siem Reap Angkor International Airport. “These projects have provided and will continue to provide great benefits to Cambodia.”Moreover, he said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, both of which entered into force in January, have been giving a big boost to Cambodia’s economic growth.“The two free trade agreements have provided larger market access for made-in-Cambodia products, and there is no doubt that Cambodia’s exports to China and other RCEP countries will be bigger and bigger in the future,” he said.Sereyvath also highlighted the growing China-Cambodia relations, saying that the ties have withstood the test of regional and international vicissitudes and grown even stronger since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1958.He said the two countries upgraded their relations to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in December 2010 and bilateral ties are currently at an all-time high.“The iron-clad friendship between Cambodia and China is made based on mutual trust, respect, help and support,” he said. “The ties between the two countries should serve as a role model of country-to-country relations.”Sharing his view on the future of China-Cambodia relations, Sereyvath said bilateral ties would continue to deepen.“Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have not only protected millions of Cambodian people’s lives and stabilized the health system, but also helped boost Cambodia’s economic recovery,” he said.Buoyed by its high vaccination rate, Cambodia has resumed all socio-economic activities with confidence and reopened its borders to travelers without quarantine since last November.“The Sino-Cambodian ties are currently very stable and unbreakable, and I think that the relations will be closer and stronger in the future, especially in politics, economics, trade, investment, tourism, culture and agriculture,” he said.

      "Xinhua – South China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as the frontier of exchanges and cooperation between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has offered an exotic taste featuring ASEAN cultures for tourists.Due to geographical proximity and cultural affinity, a strong atmosphere of cross-border cultural exchanges and integration between China and ASEAN has formed in Guangxi over the years.In Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, Thai restaurants, Indonesian snack bars, Vietnamese speciality shops and various shops with Southeast Asian elements are often seen.Fantawild Asian Legend, a theme park in Nanning showcasing the cultures of 10 ASEAN countries, has tailored specific entertainment programs such as a water splashing festival and a fireworks show for the summer. Tourists can watch a performance, showing off local customs, folk galas of Southeast Asian countries, and even appreciate magnificent sceneries of ASEAN countries in a cinema equipped with a giant hemispherical screen.Jon Aquino, an Indonesian student from Guangxi Minzu University, was impressed by the Indonesian and Thai-style buildings and Indonesian song and dance performances. “I really want to join the dance,” he said.Namdet On Anong, a Thai teacher at Guangxi University of Foreign Languages, loved the park’s high-tech ride show based on the Thai Ramakien, the National Epic of Thailand.“Technology really empowers cultural tourism. We sit on the dynamic rail car and can easily relate to this story. Many Chinese tourists around me were also attracted to the charm of Thai culture,” Namdet On Anong said. “It feels like I’m back in my hometown. It’s very warm and makes me miss home.”Lu Xiaoli from Guangdong Province brought her family to take a special photo with “Cambodian Angkor Wat” in the park, along with other landmarks of Southeast Asian countries, as the pandemic has made overseas travelling less convenient than before.“The park uses technologies to give tourists a better experience, which is like a mini trip to those countries,” she said.Hu Yang, marketing director of Fantawild, said this year’s tourist rush came earlier than usual, as the daily visitor volume exceeded 10,000, and the daily reception of out-of-town tour groups hit more than 30.“Tourism innovation has become even more important.

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128444/energy-efficiency-can-create-500k-jobs-in-cambodia/\n",
      "As many as 500,000 additional jobs can be created in Cambodia by 2030 through energy efficiency measures and a family living in Phnom Penh can cut up to $545 annually from the electricity bills through effective energy saving methods, said a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study.In a report titled “Green Economic Growth in Cambodia As A Covid-19 Response”, UNDP said the steps for energy efficiency will also contribute to the government’s effort in making electricity affordable through tariff reduction.In the case of households, electricity bills can be substantially reduced by using power more efficiently, for example through efficient appliances and better-insulated buildings, the study said.“An urban middle-class household in Phnom Penh could reduce their electricity bill by $545 a year by using efficient LEED lighting and energy-labelled refrigeration and cooling equipment,” the report pointed out. An added attraction is that the money saved in electricity costs can be used for purposes such as education and health. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy efficiency is the first step toward a sustainable global energy system. Investments in energy efficiency have also one of the highest job creation potentials out of all sustainable Covid-19 recovery measures.\n",
      "Even before the Covid-19 crisis, more than 3.3 million people held jobs in the energy efficiency industry in the US and Europe alone. Most of them were employed by small and medium-sized businesses.In the case of Cambodia, more than 500,000 additional jobs could be created by 2030 if the country follows the green industry scenario, the study said.Establishing a National Energy Management System (EMS) can also help industries reduce their electricity cost and build capacities of the local workforce, creating new jobs such as energy managers or auditors.Promoting energy management and other energy-efficient technologies in major industries (including garment, brick, food and beverage) with an estimated investment of $90 million will result in saving of $276 million until 2030, the report said.Adopting energy efficiency measures in large-scale public infrastructure investment areas can also generate more jobs. For instance, India’s Street Lighting National Programme has upgraded around 11 million streetlights with efficient LEDs and generated 13,000 jobs, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by five million tonnes per year, the report said.The UNDP recommendations for Cambodia include converting public buildings to highly energy efficient, promoting low-energy consuming affordable housing, green city concept for reducing the urban heat island effect, smart and energy-efficient public street lighting, smart electric grids and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, public transport infrastructure and creation of cycling lanes and pedestrian zones.Regarding the financing options for energy-efficient projects, the report said the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working closely with the Ministry of Mining Energy (MME) to assess the energy-efficient market and it has supported the finalisation of the National Energy Efficiency Policy (NEEP).In this context, ADB has also shown willingness to provide loans to Cambodia’s government to develop a sustainable energy efficiency market. Once the NEEP is in place, other international development banks and funds might also be willing to join.Another vehicle for loans could be the ‘Green Financing Institution’ developed by Mekong Partners with USAID and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The Green Financing Institution is envisaged to support and enable Cambodia’s shift towards a greener economy and society.Issuing green bonds can also be effective as a financing method. A green bond is a fixed-income instrument designed to support specific climate-related or environmental projects. Green bonds typically come with tax incentives to enhance their attractiveness to investors.The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently finalised economic modelling of green recovery measures in response to the Covid-19 crisis. It found that energy efficiency in buildings and industry, together with solar energy, creates the most jobs per million dollars of investment. On average, these measures create between 10 and 15 jobs for every one million dollars invested, the report said.According to EnergyLab Cambodia, solar power is now the cheapest available form of electricity in the world and by removing the over-reliance on costly oil and coal-fired power plants and raising power generation from renewable sources including solar to 35 percent of total power by 2040, Cambodia can ensure a secure energy future for the next generation.“Cambodia has over 40GW of solar power potential and excellent irradiation resources,” Bridget McIntosh, founder of EnergyLab Cambodia told Khmer Times, while urging the government not to go ahead with the proposed coal plants. \n",

      "Japan’s SoftBank reports record quarterly net loss\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128520/japans-softbank-reports-record-quarterly-net-loss/\n",
      "AFP – Japan’s SoftBank Group on Monday reported a record quarterly net loss of $23.4 billion, after central bank interest rate hikes caused tech shares to tank.The telecoms firm that has turned into an investment behemoth posted a net loss of 3.16 trillion yen, nose-diving from a net profit of 761.5 billion yen in the same April-June period the previous year.A weaker yen and the “global downward trend in share prices due to growing concerns over economic recession driven by inflation and rising interest rates” contributed to the slump, it said. Among its portfolio companies that suffered large losses for the quarter were South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang and US meal delivery platform DoorDash, SoftBank added.SoftBank’s big stakes in tech giants and volatile new ventures have made for unpredictable earnings, and it has lurched between record highs and lows in recent years.In May, it reported its worst-ever full-year net loss – and a then-record quarterly loss for Q4 – after a bruising year in 2021-22 that saw its assets hit by a US tech share rout and a regulatory crackdown in China.That came after logging Japan’s biggest-ever annual net profit in 2020-21, after people moved their lives online during the pandemic, sending tech stocks soaring.And in 2019-20, SoftBank Group reported a then-record annual net loss of 961.6 billion yen, as the emergence of Covid-19 compounded woes caused by its investment in troubled office-sharing start-up WeWork.Hideki Yasuda, senior analyst at Toyo Securities, told AFP the company “cannot help” big losses, “because the market is down”.“They have to wait for the market to rebound. You have to look at the company through the lens of long-term investment. It may experience one or two bad years, but over a decade or more, the world economy will keep growing and it could grow further.” \n",

      "Banks, MFIs raise interest rates following Fed move\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128445/banks-mfis-raise-interest-rates-following-fed-move/\n",
      "Many banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Cambodia have increased interest rates for deposits in dollar and riel currency by approximately 0.5 percent and 1 percent per annum respectively but not decreased rates for loans in the last three months, according to senior officials in the industry.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US central bank Federal Reserve raised the target range for federal funds — benchmark interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to other financial institutions — to a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent.Sok Voeun, chairman of Cambodia Microfinance Institution (CMA), told Khmer Times that about 40 percent of total investment capital in five microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDI) are loans from overseas and local lenders, while the rest are from public deposits or savings. General MFIs get loans from only overseas and local lenders to use as capital.“There must be a relationship and effect regarding the interest rate. Actually, we also have sources of capital from the US and Europe. When their central banks raise interest rates for commercial banks, while our lenders also get loans from those banks or management funds, they have to pay more interest to those institutions,” Voeun said.“Our overseas lenders have to charge us higher interest rates so that they can maintain margin at a proper level. That’s why we as the borrowers need to raise a bit more to be consistent,” Voeun said, adding that both banks and MFIs in the Kingdom will also increase interest rates for loans in the future if the interest rate for loans from overseas financial sources continues to rise.Voeun, who is also the CEO of LOLC (Cambodia) Plc, one of the five MDIs in Cambodia, went on to add that banks and MFIs have increased interest rates for deposit products in riel higher than the rate for dollar as those financial institutions have been facing a shortage of riel banknotes.“Raising interest rates is not good as it would affect the economy. Not only institutions but also financial service consumers because they have to pay higher spending on interest. We do not raise interest for loans but if the situation is like this, we will raise it,” he said, adding that banks generally have a small percentage of foreign loans in their capital.Neav Sokun, Chief Operating Officer at Small and Medium Enterprise Bank of Cambodia Plc (SME Bank), told Khmer Times that he also has noticed the new uptrend of interest rates among banks and MFIs in the Kingdom since March or April this year.“The US central bank has increased its key lending rates two times. SME Bank — operated with the technical and financial guidance of the Ministry of Economic and Finance — has not raised the interest rate yet,” he said.Cambodia currently has 58 commercial banks, nine specialised banks, and 86 microfinance institutions, with a total of 2,614 headquarters and branches as well as 3,998 automated teller machines (ATMs) throughout the country, according to the latest report of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) released late July.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128453/3-day-asean-online-shopping-fest-kicks-off/\n",
      "The three-day Asean Online Sale Day (AOSD) began yesterday with the participation of nearly 500 businesses, marking the 55th Asean Day.Organised by the Asean Coordinating Committee on E-commerce (ACCEC) from August 8 to 10, the annual online shopping event brings together the best of Asean businesses, goods and services across the region on a single platform.Consumer goods, electronics, food and beverages, cosmetics and beauty products and tourism and travel packages are made available on the e-platform onlineasean.com along with several other products and services as part of the event. Special discounts are also offered, said a release.The AOSD, which started in 2020, is meant to encourage regional digital trade and enhance stronger collaboration between stakeholders, including government agencies, the private sector, business associations and consumers, to explore new policy initiatives and to advance innovative technologies in the promotion of cross-border e-commerce activities.The two main groups of AOSD 2022 activities are domestic e-commerce shopping and cross-border e-commerce shopping.Asean’s e-commerce sector is expected to triple in size from $100 billion to $300 billion by 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic has further boosted this trend of e-commerce adoption, the release noted.It is estimated that in Southeast Asia, 40 million people came online for the first time in 2021 alone, bringing the internet penetration in the region to 75 percent. Consumption of digital services has remained strong more than a year into the pandemic – a trend that will likely continue. The total number of internet users in the region has grown to 440 million, up from 250 million in 2015.This year, AOSD hopes to further accelerate these trends and encourage consumers and businesses to engage in e-commerce across the region. The initiative also serves to reinforce and position the role of e-commerce and digital integration as a key driver of Asean’s economic growth. It complements ongoing Asean member states’ efforts to encourage digitalization among businesses.In 2020, more than 200 e-commerce businesses in Asean participated in AOSD and offered a large range of goods and services at promotional or discounted rates through their e-commerce platforms. The event continued to grow in 2021, with the participation of more than 350 businesses, the release said. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128454/pm-says-implementing-rcep-a-priority/\n",
      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement among 15 Asia-Pacific nations, will stimulate economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, Prime Minister Hun Sen said yesterday.Delivering a video message to mark the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Day, the premier said the agreement will help create jobs, and strengthen the supply chain in the region and the world as a whole.Mr Hun Sen also pointed out that the full and effective implementation of the RCEP agreement is a priority.“As the Chair of ASEAN 2022, Cambodia will work closely with RCEP countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the RCEP Agreement to further intensify the facilitation of cross-border trade movements,” the Prime Minister said.He also pointed out that Asean’s long-term growth and prosperity will depend on its resilience in re-boosting regional economic recovery and growth.“We need to put more efforts to implement a broad spectrum of initiatives ranging from industrial transformation, digitalisation, and innovation to integration of the global supply chains, digital economy and e-commerce. We need to push for a more vibrant and harmonious Asean Community by seeking more protection for our migrant workers and increasing support for green and inclusive development agenda and the UN SDGs targets. In the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we have no choice but to enable the digital transformation of our women and youth entrepreneurship,” he added.The RCEP, which came into force in January this year, comprises 10 Asean member states – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – and their five trading partners: China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.According to an Asean foreign ministers’ joint communique released recently, RCEP would be a key contributor to the recovery strategy of Asean.“The RCEP would make a significant contribution to our recovery strategy and continue to support an inclusive and open trade and investment architecture in the region,” the communique, which was released during the 55th Asean foreign ministers’ meeting in Phnom Penh, said.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 55th AMM last week, Mr Hun Sen proposed the establishment of a standalone secretariat in Cambodia to maximize the potential of the RCEP.“Cambodia is ready to host this RCEP secretariat. We have even thought of where in Phnom Penh the secretariat should be located, while we are working to formulate our detailed proposal. I hope Cambodia can win the support of fellow Asean member states, as well as all RCEP participating countries when we submit our proposal officially,” he said.Reflecting the significance of RCEP in boosting the regional economy, Cambodia’s total export to other member countries of RCEP rose 10 percent year-on-year to reach $3.28 billion in the first half of 2022.According to the Ministry of Commerce report last month, Cambodia’s top three export destinations during the period were Vietnam, China and Japan.The Kingdom shipped products worth $1.17 billion to Vietnam, $612 million to China and $542 million to Japan, the report indicated.According to China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the RCEP is expected to boost global trade by nearly three percent, with a 1.5 percent global growth effect in five years.Meanwhile, an Asian Development Bank’s study said the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 percent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment.\n",

      "In a major boost for the expansion of a new container terminal at the Sihanoukville Port, Cambodia received a 41,388,000,000 yen ($306 million) loan from Japan.At a function presided over by Prime Minister Hun Sen at the Peace Palace on Saturday, Prak Sokhonn, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and his Japanese counterpart Hayashi Yoshimasa exchanged notes and related documents on the extension of the loan.In line with the commitment made by the prime ministers of both countries earlier this year, the new loan will help Cambodia expand and modernise its Sihanoukville Autonomous Port into a principal deep-sea port in the Kingdom and region.Hem Vanndy, secretary of state at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Kamei Haruko, Chief Representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Cambodia office, signed the actual\n",
      "loan agreement.Before the signing ceremony, Yoshimasa paid a courtesy call on Mr Hun Sen and they lauded the good relationship between the countries.The Prime Minister thanked the government and people of Japan for their assistance in the development of Cambodia.Yoshimasa said he would continue to work together with his Cambodian counterpart Sokhonn to further boost Cambodia-Japan relations and cooperation, mainly in the fields of economy, investment, national defence, and other areas.Last March, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio visited Cambodia and the two prime ministers issued a joint statement outlining the direction of future cooperation. The leaders agreed to work together to make Sihanoukville a major port, located in the southwestern province of Preah Sihanouk, for Cambodia and the Mekong region.The listed seaport, the sole international and commercial deep-sea port in Cambodia, made a gross revenue of $93.2 million in 2021, up 17.6 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport.The port handled 6.9 million tonnes of containerized cargos last year, up six percent year-on-year, the ministry added.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport announced that it was developing and modernising new container ports through a study with JICA.Currently, the port can handle ships with a depth of more than 9 m and the new expansion plans help it provide services to larger ships.According to earlier reports, the container terminal port project is scheduled to start in late 2025, while the project’s phases 2 and 3 will commence in 2028 and 2029, respectively.The first phase of the container terminal is 350 metres long and 14.5 metres in depth while the second phase is 350 metres long and 16.5 metres in depth. Both the projects are scheduled to be completed in 2028 while phase 3, which is 400 metres long and 17.5 metres in depth, is scheduled to be completed in 2029.The new container terminals are being built to cater to the growing throughputs of containers and goods at the port.Currently, the port has been handling containers and goods beyond its capacity. It now handles 750,000 TEUs of containers, while the port’s capacity is 700,000 TEUs of containers.Once three container terminal projects are operational, the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port can handle the deadweight tonne containers.Sihanoukville Autonomous Port recorded a net profit of $5.9 million for the fourth quarter in 2021 due to an increase in container throughput and foreign exchange gains.PAS has also posted a 4.21 percent increase in revenue at more than $21 million in the fourth quarter, as against a revenue of $864,729 for the same quarter in 2020.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128517/markets-mixed-as-strong-us-jobs-data-fans-fed-rate-hike-bets/\n",
      "AFP – Markets were mixed Monday and the dollar held big gains as a blockbuster US jobs report ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will announce more sharp interest rate hikes as it tries to tame runaway inflation.While the employment reading – which was more than twice as high as expected – indicated the world’s top economy remained resilient despite rising prices and borrowing costs, it will complicate the central bank’s plans to tighten monetary policy.Traders have hoped that with several indicators pointing to a slowdown, including GDP figures showing a technical recession, policymakers could begin to ease back on their pace of rate hikes.Now, speculation is growing that the Fed will have to announce a third successive 75 basis-point increase next month, particularly as officials have said their decisions will be data-dependent.“Friday’s payroll report indicates an overheated labour market that continues to tighten further,” said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.“Hence at minimum, the markets expect another 100 basis points of Fed funds rate increases over the next three meetings… with risks skewed towards significant increases.”All eyes are now on the release this week of US July inflation data, which is expected to show a slight slowdown from June but still at four-decade highs.The “report seems very unlikely to offer ‘compelling evidence’ of a slowdown needed for the Fed to pull away from its aggressive inflation-fighting mode”, Innes added.The jobs figures left Wall Street’s main indexes mixed Friday, and Asia followed suit with markets fluctuating in early trade.However, there was some relief that tensions had calmed since US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last week sparked a furious reaction from China, including live-fire military drills around the island that continued Monday.Hong Kong fell, with little excitement generated by news that the city will cut the amount of time incoming travellers must spend in hotel quarantine.Singapore, Taipei, Bangkok, Jakarta and Wellington were also down, but Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai and Manila edged up.Shanghai was boosted by better-than-expected Chinese trade data, though the gains were tempered by fresh worries about Covid lockdowns in the country that threaten the economic recovery.London, Frankfurt and Paris rose in the morning.Oil demand concernsThe prospect of higher interest rates sent the dollar surging, and it held on to those gains in Asia.Oil rose but bets on a recession across leading economies continued to fuel concerns about demand – figures last week indicated Americans were driving less now than in summer 2020 at the height of the pandemic.A rise in US stockpiles was partly responsible for a 10 percent drop in the commodity last week, pushing WTI below $90 for the first time since February.Both main contracts have lost all the gains seen in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which led the United States and Europe to ban imports of Russian crude, hammering already thin supplies.Fresh talks on Iran’s nuclear programme were being followed.“The resumption of Iran nuclear talks… is one potential downside risk for the oil price, given the ability of the country to quickly ramp up production if a deal is struck,” said OANDA’s Craig Erlam.“Not to mention its reportedly large oil and gas reserves. A deal could apparently be struck within days, although we have heard that a lot at times this year.”\n",

      "power complex has been under Russian control since the early days of the February 24 invasion.Recent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.Russia’s occupying authorities in the town of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, said the Ukrainian army overnight “carried out a strike with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan multiple rocket launcher”.The projectiles fell “within 400 metres of a working reactor” and in a “zone storing used nuclear fuel”, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported.Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Enerhoatom, however, said the “Russian occupiers once again fired rockets at the nuclear power plant (and) its host town, Enerhodar”.AFP was not able to confirm the allegations from an independent source.Without assigning blame, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike in remarks from Tokyo on Monday morning.“Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing. I hope that those attacks will end, and at the same time I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant,” he said.On Saturday, Enerhoatom had already said parts of the facility had been “seriously damaged” by military strikes the previous day, forcing the shutdown of one of its reactors.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in his nightly address Sunday, called for a “principled response” from the international community.Evoking the possibility that the plant was hit causing the release of a toxic cloud, he added: “No one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination.”Amnesty’s regretAmnesty International on Sunday said it deeply regretted the “distress and anger” caused after it alleged Ukrainian forces were flouting international law by exposing civilians to Russian fire, but stood by its controversial report.The Thursday report, which sparked outrage in Ukraine, accused the military of endangering civilians by establishing bases in schools and hospitals, and launching counter-attacks from heavily populated areas.Meanwhile, the renewed shipments of Ukrainian grain to help ease global food shortages and bring down prices offered a small glimmer of hope as the war entered its sixth month.Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, had been forced to halt almost all deliveries in the wake of Russia’s invasion.That sent global food prices soaring, making imports prohibitively expensive for some of the world’s poorest nations.A bulk carrier arrived in Chornomorsk on Saturday to be loaded with grain for the first time since Moscow’s invasion.The departure Sunday of the four other vessels, along with Monday’s planned departure of two more, came after several others set sail last week under a deal brokered with the help\n",

      "The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has started to set the official exchange rate for the dollar based on the foreign exchange buying and selling prices in the currency market from August 2.NBC announced that the official exchange rate on the National Bank of Cambodia Platform (NBCP) is based on the exchange rate in the currency market the previous day and is to be set every morning.“This is because NBCP is highly active now with many banking and financial institutions raising the volume of transactions through it,” the statement said.NBC’s announcement was made at a time when commercial banks are having self-set exchange rates for use.For example, the KHR/USD exchange rate of ACLEDA Bank Plc was KHR 4,108 yesterday, while the official exchange rate of NBC was KHR 4,103.Meanwhile, the exchange rate of the General Department of Taxation, which sets its official exchange rate daily, was KHR 4,108 against $1 yesterday.Bun Neary, Deputy Director General of the GDT, said the official exchange rate would be helpful for some taxpayers who use dollars for payment.“This official exchange rate we set daily is based on the rates of four major commercial banks and it is a measure to help our taxpayers who use dollars,” Neary said in a press meet at the Government Spokesman Unit.According to the provisions in the Organization and Conduct of the NBC in Article 31, the central bank regularises the domestic exchange rate and is authorised to declare the official foreign exchange rates for the riel to other currencies and is to participate in international financial agreements on behalf of the government.The introduction of the official exchange rate is to ensure an accurate billing verification mechanism, particularly it facilitates online claiming of refunds and use of value-added tax credit efficiently, said Kong Vibol, director-general of the GDT.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501127587/usaid-to-launch-25-million-food-security-project-in-cambodia-this-week/\n",
      "The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will launch ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’, a new $25 million project this week to promote food security and economic growth in Cambodia’s agriculture sector over the next five years, US senior officials said.US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that Harvest III will be implemented with more farmers, especially women and young people in all provinces nationwide and add grains, fish and other products to fruits, vegetables and spices to help farmers boost their incomes.“It will continue to help farmers boost their income, for example, by increasing access to tools like greenhouses, which can help lengthen growing seasons, improve the quality of what’s grown, and help products actually meet market standards,” Blinken said, adding that more than 60 percent of Cambodians live in rural areas.He went on to add that Cambodia and the US have worked together to increase crop yields, improve the health of livestock, promote climate resilience, train farmers and create markets but more than three-quarters of those Cambodian rural households rely on agriculture, fisheries or forestry as their main source of income and many of them have only limited access to markets or financing.“And we’ll help connect more Cambodian farmers and businesses to market both here at home and abroad. We want to change that so that more people can enjoy Cambodian products and more farmers and entrepreneurs can grow their businesses,” Blinken said.It is also a security issue because widespread hunger makes communities and countries less secure, particularly when food security around the world is on the rise because of Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine, which has blocked millions of tonnes of Ukrainian crops from being shipped to global markets.Over the five-year duration of the project, USAID anticipates generating $38 million in new private sector investments, creating more than 3,000 new jobs, helping Cambodian agriculture businesses and producers access $15 million in financing, and generating $100 million in sales, according to a statement released by the US Embassy in Cambodia.The statement pointed out that Harvest III will work with Cambodian agriculture cooperatives, technology providers, financial institutions, and other private sector stakeholders to develop a skilled workforce, create jobs, and capture market opportunities for farmers.The project will build on investments that USAID Cambodia has made over the past decade, promoting sustainable economic opportunities, introducing climate-smart agriculture technologies, and improving livelihoods for Cambodians, especially women, youth, and marginalized populations.US Ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy said the agriculture sector accounts for more than 20 percent of Cambodia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employs over 3 million Cambodians directly, and has been an incredible source of resilience during the pandemic during which agriculture absorbed many people who lost jobs, particularly in the tourism sector.USAID and the US Department of Agriculture have programs in food security and, more broadly agriculture, which have been critical to this resilience and in helping the sector’s economic potential.“As ambassador, I am charged with doing what I can to strengthen the relations between our two countries, and that means getting to meet lots of farmers and helping them expand trade between our two countries and bring technology, which really helps in this country with efficiencies and adding value to their products, and achieving more sustainable development,” Ambassador Murphy said.About 12 years ago, the United States launched an initiative called Cambodia Harvest, and that was part of our flagship global food security program called Feed the Future. The idea behind Feed the Future is that when it comes to chronic food insecurity, food aid is vital but it is not enough. \n",

      "Huione Life Insurance Plc, which received approval from the Ministry of Economy and Finance to operate a life insurance business, is scheduled to launch its operations along with its main product Happylife on August 8.Talking about the prospects of, HappyLife, the DCEO, Liu Zhi Hao, said “It has the widest coverage age, ranging from one to 60 years old, with the most flexible coverage term, starting from three years to 15 years, with the coverage amount up to 450 percent, and considerable maturity benefit.”“I have several years of experience in the insurance field and my area of expertise has been life insurance marketing.He pointed out the potential for growth in the life insurance industry in the Kingdom. “As of now, there are 14 life insurance companies and in 2021, the total premium for Cambodia’s insurance industry reached $300 million while the share of life insurance was $170 million. The life insurance penetration rate is up to 1.1 percent, and the insurance density is only $18 per capita, which is far lower than the level of other countries in Southeast Asia. He said the core of life insurance is people-oriented, and health and wealth are very indispensable for the people. While explaining the mission of the company, he said, “The core business of our company is product and service.”Huione Life Insurance has also formed  a strategic partnership with Panda Commercial Bank.“I am glad that we have established a strategic partnership with Panda Commercial Bank Plc. I think the premise of cooperation is that the core business of both companies should match each other. We have a high tacit understanding with Panda Commercial Bank in the concept of digitalization and innovation. We will also provide full support to all the marketing activities of Panda Commercial Bank. “Ms. Liaw has more than 30 years of financial experience in Singapore and I have financial experience from China,” he said.The company is also focusing attention on digitalization.Another important focus of the company would be on humanistic care. “I require our team to think about what customers want and what their concerns are.”“I often talk in a humorous way that each insurance policy is like a “marriage license” for us and our customers, and that we have a responsibility on our “other half.”“I hope that health-related life insurance products of Huione Life can penetrate and comprehensively improve the health awareness of people. \n",

      "ASEAN lauds achievements under comprehensive strategic partnership\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501127761/asean-lauds-achievements-under-comprehensive-strategic-partnership/\n",
      "Xinhua – Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the China-ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting here on Thursday, during which the Chinese and ASEAN sides spoke highly of the achievements in their cooperation and pledged to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.The meeting, co-chaired by Wang and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, was attended by the foreign ministers of 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Lim Jock Hoi.Wang said that since Chinese President Xi Jinping and leaders of the ASEAN countries jointly announced the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in November last year, the development of the partnership has got off to a good start with promising results yielded in various fields.The two sides have worked together to meet the challenges from various spillovers, and jointly maintained the hard-won peace and stability in the region, safeguarding “an oasis of peace,” he said.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, both sides showed solidarity in fighting the disease and strengthened cooperation in emergency management so as to build “a shield of safety,” said Wang.Both sides also jointly implemented the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and accelerated connectivity, creating “a highland for development,” he said.In addition, the two sides have strengthened cooperation to boost green development, address climate change, enhance ecological environmental protection, and promote energy transformation, while cementing public support by increasing direct flights, helping students from ASEAN countries to return to study in China in an orderly manner, and strengthening exchanges and cooperation in culture, tourism, think tanks and sports, he said.Wang said that China is willing to work with ASEAN to continue advancing the building of a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, to implement the important consensuses reached by the leaders of the two sides, to continue deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership, and to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, so as to make greater contributions to regional peace and development.Wang put forward a four-point proposal in this regard.First, the two sides should build a model of common development. Both sides should strengthen the synergy between their development strategies to achieve a higher level of mutual benefit.China is stepping up efforts to honour its commitment to providing assistance to ASEAN countries for their development, and facilitate the implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) in ASEAN countries, Wang said.He noted that both sides should jointly address pressing challenges such as public health, food and energy.Second, the two sides should set an example of connectivity. Wang said both sides should join hands to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, welcome more countries to participate in the construction of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and ensure the safety and smooth flow of industrial and supply chains.He said the two sides should work together to push for high-quality RCEP implementation, accelerate the follow-up negotiations on the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and expand cooperation in digital and green economy.Third, the two sides should strengthen coordination on global governance. Wang said the two sides should uphold open regionalism, promote true multilateralism, expand and strengthen the ASEAN-led regional structure, and jointly safeguard the interests of developing countries, so as to make “Asian contributions” to global governance.China appreciates that the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) adheres to independence, openness and inclusiveness, and focuses on development and cooperation, Wang said, adding China is willing to work with ASEAN countries to jointly enhance the synergy between the outlook and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as between that and the GDI.Fourth, the two sides should jointly maintain regional peace and stability. Noting that the Global Security Initiative (GSI) shares the security philosophy advocated by ASEAN, Wang said China is ready to work with ASEAN to explore the implementation of the initiative in ASEAN countries.He said both sides should speed up their consultation on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC),and hold the key to the issue in the hands of regional countries, so as to turn the South China Sea into a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship. Wang proposed the establishment of a China-ASEAN year of cooperation on agricultural development and food security, as well as the issuance of a joint statement on food security cooperation at the China-ASEAN leaders’ meeting.The Chinese side also circulated a document on China’s support for ASEAN’s central position, a list of supporting cooperation in the four priority areas of the AOIP, a progress report on building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, and a fact list on building a China-ASEAN blue economy partnership, among others.The foreign ministers attending the meeting spoke highly of the dynamic ASEAN-China cooperation with rich substance and remarkable achievements since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two sides, appreciated China’s consistent support for ASEAN’s central position, and thanked China for providing vaccines to ASEAN countries in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Viewing China as a partner with mutual benefit and a shared vision, ASEAN countries said they fully endorse President Xi’s proposal to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, and look forward to the synergy of the BRI and the AOIP, and to further exploring the implementation of the GDI and the GSI in ASEAN.The foreign ministers expressed satisfaction with the progress made in RCEP implementation and appreciated China for taking the lead in reaching a free trade agreement with ASEAN.They said they look forward to accelerating follow-up negotiations on upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, and pushing for substantive progress in the consultation of the COC to jointly safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity.During the meeting, Wang further expounded on China’s solemn stance on the provocation by the US side to infringe on China’s sovereignty.All parties at the meeting said they adhere to the one-China policy and support China in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity.The ASEAN foreign ministers also issued a statement on the cross-Strait situation, reiterating their countries’ firm adherence to the one-China principle.The meeting also approved an action plan for the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership, which will be submitted to the China-ASEAN leaders’ meeting for endorsement.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501127760/tonnes-of-fruits-stranded-in-eu-south-africa-battle-of-oranges/\n",
      "AFP – Millions of boxes of oranges are spoiling in containers stranded at European ports as South Africa and the European Union lock horns in a dispute over import rules, citrus growers have said.South Africa, the world’s second-largest exporter of fresh citrus after Spain, filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) last month after the EU introduced new plant and health safety requirements that orange farmers say threaten their survival.The measures came into force in July as ships were already at sea carrying hundreds of containers full of South African fruit to Europe, resulting in them being held up on arrival, South Africa’s Citrus Growers’ Association (CGA) says.“It’s a complete and utter disaster,” CGA’s CEO Justin Chadwick told AFP by phone.“Food that has fantastic quality and is safe is (just) sitting there – and this at a time when people are worried about food security.”The EU rules aim at tackling the potential spread of an insect called the false codling moth, a pest native to sub-Saharan Africa that feeds on fruits including oranges and grapefruits.The new measures require South African farmers to apply extreme cold treatment to all Europe-bound oranges and keep the fruits at temperatures of two degrees Celsius (35 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower for 25 days.But the CGA says this measure is unnecessary as the country already has its own, more targeted way of preventing infestation.In its WTO complaint, South Africa argued that the EU requirements were “not based on science”, more restrictive than necessary and “discriminatory”.South African citrus growers say the requirement puts undue extra pressure on an industry already in dire straits.“This is going to add a lot of costs… and at the moment, that is what no grower in the world can afford,” said Hannes de Waal, who heads of the almost 100-year-old farm Sundays River Citrus.De Waal, whose company has orange, clementine and lemon trees straddling 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) near the southeastern coast city of Gqeberha, said revenues were already squeezed by high shipping and fertiliser costs.Freight costs have rocketed since Covid-19 struck, and so has the price of fertilisers due to the war in Ukraine – Russia being one of the world’s largest producers.‘Under pressure’Europe is the largest market for South Africa’s almost $2 billion citrus industry, accounting for 37 percent of all exports, according to the CGA.The new rules hit at the height of South Africa’s orange season, during the southern hemisphere’s winter, when export operations were in full swing.This gave fruit growers too little time to adapt, said Chadwick.Some 3.2 million cartons of citrus worth about 605 million rand ($36 million) left port with paperwork that would be wrong on arrival.The South African government was scrambling to issue new documents for shipments that met the new criteria, but hundreds of containers could be slated for destruction, said Chadwick.South Africa already has an effective anti-moth system, the CGA says.“Our system does involve cold treatment, but targeted at the risk, whereas the EU measure is a blanket measure that covers all oranges,” Chadwick said.“The higher the risk, the more extreme the cold treatment,” he said, of the South African measures.The dispute is now with the WTO. The parties have 60 days to negotiate a solution. Failing that, the complainant can request the matter be decided by a panel of experts.The EU said it was confident of the “WTO-compatibility” of its measures.“The objective of the EU’s plant and health safety criteria is to protect the union territory from the potential significant impact on the agriculture and the environment, should this pest establish itself in the union,” a spokesperson for the EU Commission said in a statement.Chadwick hopes that “sense” will prevail and a quick fix can be found.“Our industry is under pressure. It’s basically a year of survival,” he said.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501127818/syria-petrol-prices-more-than-double/\n",
      "AFP – Syria’s internal commerce ministry has announced a petrol price hike of around 130 percent in the war-torn country facing fuel shortages and extended power cuts.The cost of a litre of subsidised fuel will rise to 2,500 Syrian pounds, from 1,100 previously, a rise of 127 percent, the ministry said in a statement quoted by the official SANA news agency late Saturday.The cost of non-subsidised petrol will rise from 3,500 to 4,000 Syrian pounds, the ministry added.The increases represent the third time this year that authorities have increased the price of fuel, as the Syrian pound continues to depreciate. Syria’s currency is trading at around 4,250 to the dollar on the black market, compared to an official rate of 2,814.“This measure will hit everyone,” said Raed al-Saadi, a worker. “Our salary is now only enough to get us to the workplace, and not even enough to get us home again.”“Life has become very difficult and I don’t where this situation will lead us,” the 48-year-old added.Since the outbreak of war in 2011, Syria’s oil and gas sector has suffered losses amounting to tens of billions of dollars.The economy has been hit hard by both the long-running war and sanctions imposed against Damascus.A UN commission in March called for a review of sanctions against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime because of concerns that the measures were hitting ordinary people too hard.The conflict in Syria started in 2011 with the brutal repression of peaceful protests and escalated to pull in foreign powers and jihadists. It has killed 500,000 people and displaced half of the country’s population.\n",

It’s located in the same city, where the UNESCO-listed Angkor Archaeological Park is situated. Invested and constructed by Chinese enterprises, the airport is an iconic project under the Belt and Road Initiative.FENG LI Project Manager, Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Project “We are now working on the mechanical and electrical installations at the terminal building and its decorative design. And we’re also busy concreting the pavement of the airfield area. We’re determined to finish the whole project in three years as planned.”The project kicked off in March 2020, when the COVID outbreak had just started. During the past two years, the pandemic has posed a big challenge, making the cross-border transportation of both employees and materials a real headache.FENG LI Project Manager, Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Project “We’ve taken strict measures to avoid large-scale infections that may suspend construction. We’ve asked our staff to get vaccinated and quarantine when necessary, and we’ve also been monitoring everyone’s body temperature.”The project involves more than 1,000 local workers. The airport is scheduled to be completed in March next year and become operational in October.TEKRETH SAMRACH Chairman, Steering Committee for Construction of Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport “The airport itself will promote trade, investment, tourist arrival, air transportation services. This will lead to economic growth and job creation for Cambodian people. Tourist industry plays a very important role in Cambodian economy. It takes up like 15 to 17% of our GDP. This is going to be the biggest airport in Cambodia.”And bilateral cooperation goes far beyond infrastructure. The Chinese company in charge of the construction of the airport is also carrying out an educational project, aiming to upgrade facilities of 27 schools across Cambodia. The company says they attach equal importance to both project quality and social responsibility.HU KAILIN General Manager, International Engineering Department, Yunnan Construction and Investment Holding Group Company “We try to use environmentally-friendly products and strictly follow local laws and regulations to protect the natural environment, like forests and prevent pollution.

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501126766/asean-foreign-ministers-say-rcep-key-contributor-to-regions-recovery-strategy/\n",
      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement would be a key contributor to the recovery strategy of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to an ASEAN foreign ministers’ joint communique released here on Friday.In the joint communique issued after the 55th ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting (55th AMM) held in Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia, the ministers welcomed the entry into force of the RCEP from Jan 1, 2022.“The RCEP would make significant contribution to our recovery strategy and continue to support an inclusive and open trade and investment architecture in the region,” the communique said.The ministers also welcomed the outcomes of the first RCEP Joint Committee (RJC) Meeting in April, which discussed the preparation of RCEP implementation, including the establishment of the committees to monitor RCEP implementation and the endorsement of the key elements on the establishment of the RCEP secretariat.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 55th AMM on Wednesday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen proposed the establishment of a standalone secretariat in Cambodia to maximize the potential of the RCEP.“Cambodia is ready to host this RCEP secretariat. We have even thought of where in Phnom Penh the secretariat should be located, while we are working to formulate our detailed proposal,” he said.“I hope Cambodia can win the support of fellow ASEAN member states, as well as all RCEP participating countries when we submit our proposal officially.”The RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.The mega-regional pact will eliminate as much as 90 percent of the tariffs on goods traded among its signatories over the next 20 years.Being the world’s largest trade bloc, the RCEP established a market of 2.2 billion people, or 30 percent of the world population with a combined Gross Domestic Product of $26.2 trillion, which represents around 30 percent of global GDP and 28 percent of global trade.According to an Asian Development Bank’s study, the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 percent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment. China DailyCambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman Penn Sovicheat said the RCEP would inject a new impetus into regional and global economic growth in the long term.“The RCEP will give a big boost to our economy in the post-pandemic era,” he told Xinhua. “It is also a well-timed intervention in Cambodia’s quest for a Least Developed Country (LDC) graduation, likely by 2028 and the country’s planned endeavor to achieve the upper-middle income and high-income statuses by 2030 and 2050, respectively.”Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute of the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said the RCEP is instrumental in subverting creeping unilateralism because it pulls all bilateral free trade agreements into one economic sphere, under one blanket trade ruling.“It is the most ambitious regional free trade agreement in Asia in which China has played a vital role in converting Asian economy into a core economic polar aimed at averting protectionism and the widespread negative impacts of the trade war,” he told Xinhua.\n",

      "Minister for Asia, Amanda Milling has visited Cambodia this week and announced a milestone agreement on a range of issues with influential countries in Southeast Asia, according to a statement of the UK Government released yesterday.The new Plan of Action will deepen cooperation on trade and investment, defence and security – including maritime security and cyber – as well as climate change, girls’ education, digital and science and technology.Amanda Milling said the UK continues to deepen its economic ties and strengthen its security partnerships with these fast-growing economies in Southeast Asia.Practical measures including opening a new BII office in Singapore to boost investment and providing training on security and maritime law demonstrate the ongoing commitment to the region and increased engagement in the Indo-Pacific, she added.Ms Milling co-chaired the ASEAN-UK Post-Ministerial Conference today, the first since the UK became an ASEAN Dialogue Partner. The UK’s Dialogue Partner status, the first ASEAN has agreed to in 25 years, was formalised in August 2021 and an important part to the UK’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific.Closer ties with the Southeast Asia bloc will help create green jobs, reinforce our security cooperation, promote tech and science partnerships, and safeguard key pillars of international law like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The Minister also announced that InfraCo Asia, which the UK supports through its funding to the Private Infrastructure Development Group, is providing a $2.3 million loan to support the development of Cambodia’s water supply network.During the meeting, Minister Milling made clear that Russia’s unprovoked, premeditated and barbaric attack against the sovereign democratic state of Ukraine remains in the hearts of the British people and the UK stands united with international partners in condemning the Russian government’s reprehensible actions.On Myanmar, Minister Milling strongly condemned the recent appalling and barbaric executions of pro-democracy activists by the Myanmar junta. She reiterated the UK continues to support ASEAN’s Five Point Consensus on Myanmar and the urgent need for an immediate end to the violence and for a peaceful solution to the crisis.Since becoming Dialogue Partner, the UK invited ASEAN to be represented at the G7 Foreign Ministers last December and during the global Covid-19 pandemic, donated 4.3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to ASEAN members and contributed £1m to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund.The UK also recently signed an MoU with the Asian Development Bank to support ASEAN states to invest in green infrastructure through a £107m trust fund to support the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility.

      "Jiangsu General Science Technology Co Ltd, a Chinese listed tyre company, established a wholly-owned subsidiary General Intelligence (Cambodia) Co Ltd in the Kingdom to produce five million semi-steel radial tyres and 900,000 steel-belted radial tyres annually at Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) with an investment of $300 million.An official of General Intelligence told Khmer Times that Cambodia has a favourable investment environment, including a stable domestic political environment, steady economic growth, and preferential tax policies of the government.“It can make better use of local rubber resources and human resources to establish production bases in Cambodia,” the official said.“The location of this project is at an international industrial park in Cambodia. It is close to the airport, port and highway, and has good geological advantages,” he said, adding that this is the first tyre factory in SSEZ.The brand of tyres produced is mainly ‘CELIMO’, a high-end tyre brand. The tyres will be sold to the United States, Brazil, Southeast Asia and other countries.It is expected that more than 1,600 jobs will be added. After the operation and development of the company, it will fully promote the local economic development and stimulate domestic demand.Jiangsu General Science Technology is actively deploying overseas production bases for the demands of international development.As early as 2018, before the company set up a production base in Thailand, it planned to invest and build a factory in Cambodia and carried out a lot of preliminary research and field visits.Jiangsu General Science Technology Co has restarted the project construction on nearly 180,000 square metres of the total planned land area of the factory and over 200,000 square metres of the total construction area in Cambodia.Chhin Chien Kang, chairman of the Board of Directors of Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, said that from January to June 2022, the value of exports and imports at the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone reached $1.3 billion, an increase of 38 percent compared to the previous year.Following the global epidemic of Covid-19, the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone has strived to secure production lines and has attracted a total of 170 enterprises from Europe, the United States, China and Southeast Asia, and created nearly 30,000 jobs.SSEZ—jointly developed and constructed by private companies from both Cambodia and China—will form an ecological model park with supporting functions for 300 enterprises for employment of 80,000 to 100,000 industrial workers. \n",

      "The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications plans to connect 2,715 kilometres of submarine fibre optic cable network from Hong Kong to Preah Sihanouk, Chea Vandeth, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, said yesterday.The project, which will be launched this year, is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, the minister said in a press conference at the office of the Council of Ministers.He said that after the completion of this network connection, the internet capacity in the country will be wider than before, and the users would not have to worry about a weak internet connection. Besides, the country will also have access to cheaper internet services.“We have about 640 kilometres of submarine cable network and we are considering 2,700 kilometres from Hong Kong,” Vandeth said.He also pointed out that the country has around 17.8 million internet subscribers, exceeding the country’s total population of 16 million because many people have subscribed to more than one internet service.The minister said about 17.48 million have subscribed to the mobile internet service and 312,233 to the fixed internet service.“The high number of internet users has importantly contributed to the development of e-commerce in Cambodia,” he said.Vandeth said e-commerce has seen rapid development in recent years and that the market value of e-commerce in Cambodia was $970 million in 2021 and is projected to rise to $1.1 billion in 2022.“E-commerce market value is predicted to reach $1.78 billion in 2025,” he said.Cambodia currently has five mobile phone operators and 38 internet service providers, the minister said.Around 13.2 million people in the country use Facebook while there have been 2 million users on Instagram.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125998/southeast-asia-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-5-in-2022/\n",
      "The Asian Development Bank revised its GDP growth projections for Southeast Asian countries in 2022 to 5 percent, slightly up from its earlier estimates of 4.9 percent.The bank, which maintained the forecast for 2023 at 5.2 percent, made its observations regarding the economic performance of Asean Countries in its Asian Development Outlook Supplement for July.The bank also significantly raised Southeast Asia’s inflation forecast for 2022 from 3.7 percent to 4.7 percent. Inflation next year is revised up, from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent.It said consumption growth in all subregional economies rebounded strongly in the first five months of this year due to the gradual lifting of Covid-19 mobility restrictions and the reopening of markets and borders.The bank observed that the manufacturing and services output has been increasing in most economies, helping create jobs and lifting household incomes.However, it warned that the countries in the region face some significant challenges, including higher oil prices, the end of low global interest rates, and trade and supply disruptions.It said such factors have dimmed the outlook for some economies\n",
      "in 2022 and 2023.“Smaller economies in particular are being more heavily affected by supply disruptions and inflation from higher oil prices. Tourist arrivals are picking up, albeit very slowly,” the report mentioned.It also pointed out that the economies in the subregion with high vaccination rates have yet to see meaningful tourism revivals.It raised the growth projection for Indonesia from 5 percent to 5.2 percent due to the robust domestic demand and exports.The bank said increased uncertainty and weaker global growth have been dampening Malaysia’s prospects.“Growth of five percent in Q1 2022 was underpinned by strong private consumption and increased government assistance through the Bantuan Keluarga family assistance programme. But business confidence and the PMI continue to soften in step with weaker global prospects and supply disruptions from cities in the PRC that were locked down to tackle Covid-19 outbreaks,” the report said.The bank also raised the growth forecast for the Philippines from 6 percent to 6.5 percent for 2022 on a stronger-than-expected first quarter performance, underpinned by rebounds in investment and household consumption.“Wider Covid-19 vaccination coverage and relatively mild health impacts from the Omicron variant allowed the economy to reopen further,” it added.According to the report, Singapore’s growth will remain firm in 2022, supported by robust information technology and financial services, sustained manufacturing growth, and a gradual recovery in tourism and domestic-oriented services sectors.The bank also maintained a growth forecast of 6.5 percent for this year and 6.7 percent for next year for Viet Nam.It said the Lao PDR’s economic prospects in 2022 are looking dimmer because of declining consumer and business confidence caused by rising prices and a weaker local currency. However, the outlook is expected to improve in 2023. “While there are slight improvements in industry and services growth in Myanmar, political tensions and a volatile security situation remain the major downside risks to economic recovery,” the report pointed out. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125999/over-emphasis-on-digitalisation-hurt-msmes-during-covid-19/\n",
      "Some of the main mistakes the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Southeast Asia made during the Covid-19 pandemic period include over-emphasis on digitalisation, informal operations, spiralling costs, and failure to avail of government schemes, a report said.Many MSMEs went digital to overcome the crisis and many of them proved successful during the Covid-19 crisis.“It improved access to business information, strengthened business networks, created business opportunities (including access to global marketplaces and global supply chains), and reduced administrative costs,” according to a new Asian Development Bank (ADB) report based on surveys.According to the report, digitalisation did not ensure profitability.In Indonesia, the share of those with a more than six percent income increase was likely higher in digitally operated MSMEs than non-digital MSMEs in August–September 2020, the report pointed out. They were mainly small firms selling essential daily goods, food, and health-care products and delivering them. However, toward 2021, the share of those with no revenue or more than a 30 percent decrease in income likely increased among digitally operated MSMEs than non-digital MSMEs. Some of the reasons cited were limited demand for nonessential goods and services during social restrictions, weak business models and starting the enterprise without a business strategy, unfamiliarity with using technology for operations, and poor cost management during digitalisation, the report mentioned.Another mistake made by MSMEs was their informal operations. By not registering a business, they failed to secure access to bank credit because of the requirement of formal documentation to secure a loan. The informal lines of credit have higher interest rates, putting many of them at debt risk.“The MSMEs surveyed continued to struggle to reduce costs a year into the pandemic,” the report said.“The debt burden is quite heavy on them and the servicing needs that arise from these debts obviously pose an enormous burden on the enterprises,” Ramesh Subramaniam, director general of ADB’s Southeast Asia Department, was quoted as saying in the report.The results suggest that better cost management is needed for MSMEs to survive, given the protracted pandemic and outbreaks of new Covid-19 variants.The survey also indicated the lack of information on several government programmes. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501126004/mekong-institute-receives-asean-prize-in-cambodia/\n",
      "The intergovernmental Mekong Institute (MI) which works on socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) was on Wednesday awarded the Asean Prize 2021 at the 55th Asean Ministerial Meeting hosted by Cambodia in Phnom Penh, senior officials said.MI was founded and represented by Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam to support international, regional cooperation and economic integration through agriculture development and commercialization, trade and investment facilitation and sustainable energy and environment, while addressing issues of social inclusion and vulnerability, digital economy and innovation, and labour mobility.Suriyan Vichitlekarn, executive director of Thailand-based MI received the award from Cambodia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He told Khmer Times that the institute works on the four areas of specialisation through developing the capacity of government officials and institutions in the region.MI is promoting logistics, infrastructure development, e-commerce, small and medium enterprise development, food safety, quality, standard, cross-border value chain, sustainable and green energy, environmental responsibility in terms of green and resilient economy and labour mobility, according to Vichitlekarn.“It also means that Asean recognises the growing importance of Mekong countries and what we have done to the countries also contributes to the strengths and achievements of Asean. So, we will continue to do it better to reduce the development gap so that these countries can be very close to other Asean countries,” he said.He added that to achieve international recognition with the Asean Prize, firstly MI has developed the capacity of about 7,500 alumni in the region who gradually become policymakers and contribute to the regional cooperation and secondly, it created a platform for the government, private sector, civil society and academic institutions to work together and thirdly conduct research on policy implementation issues.“So, we have become a true partner. I think this is something that the prize may imply to all the people that Mekong countries are not only members but also we are important members and we will use the opportunity of being the winner to advocate the importance of the development of the region,” he said.Vichitlekarn explained that MI will not only find ways to approach donors and development partners to provide stronger support, as Mekong countries will become stronger as it forms  half of Asean and also connects to other Asean countries on mainland Asia to share its experience among Mekong and Asean countries.Chea Chantum, Secretary General of General Secretariat for Population and Development of the Ministry of Planning, told Khmer Times that about 1,300 officials who are working in Cambodia including himself and his colleagues are among the 7,500 alumni of MI and he attended a three-week training at the institute in 1998.“The prize is evidence that our government contributes to the institute and what it has been doing is on the right track. Personally, I am proud of the prize and I think the government will also be proud of this as well,” Chantum said.Hang Suviddya, Deputy Secretary General of General Secretariat for Population and Development of the Ministry of Planning, said that the award may inspire non-governmental organizations in Cambodia to work harder to the next level if they want to be recognised with such awards.“When I have an opportunity, I will tell them that the institute is a symbol,” said Suviddya, who is an alumni and attended a one-month training on economic integration at MI.Pornwilai Anne Pumira, Partnership and Resource Mobilization at MI, said the Ministry of Planning in Cambodia is also working with the institution and helping the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in organizing the 55th Asean Ministerial Meeting and related meetings hosted by Cambodia in Phnom Penh. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501126000/german-industrial-orders-slide-in-june/\n",
      "Frankfurt (AFP) – German industrial orders dipped in June, official figures published Thursday showed, as Europe’s largest economy faced the threat of a recession in the months to come.New orders — which usually provide a foretaste of industrial output — fell by 0.4 percent in June from the previous month, the federal statistics agency Destatis calculated.The previous month’s reading was revised to show a drop of 0.2 percent, having previously shown a small improvement.The switch meant Germany had now seen industrial orders drop for five consecutive months.The overall drop was “mostly due” to a 4.3 percent decline in the volume of orders from outside the eurozone, Destatis said.Meanwhile, orders from within the eurozone and Germany rose by 3.4 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.Orders for capital goods used in production fell by 1.8 percent, while those of intermediate and consumer goods rose by 1.2 and 1.7 percent.The downwards turn in many economic indicators has led analysts to warn of a downturn in Germany.Increasing pessimism among businesses suggested Germany was “on the cusp of a recession”, said Ifo Institute president Clemens Fuest.The German economy stagnated between April and June, registering a growth of zero percent, according to official figures published last week. \n",

      "Beijing (AFP) – Chinese military exercises around Taiwan are set to disrupt one of the world’s busiest shipping zones, analysts told AFP, highlighting the island’s critical position in already stretched global supply chains.The drills – China’s largest-ever around Taiwan – are a major show of strength after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi infuriated Beijing by visiting the island.The manoeuvres kicked off Thursday and will take place along some of the busiest shipping routes on the planet, used to supply vital semiconductors and electronic equipment produced in East Asian factory hubs to global markets.The routes are also a key artery for natural gas.Nearly half the world’s container ships passed through the narrow Taiwan Strait – which separates the island from the Chinese mainland – in the first seven months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Given that much of the world’s container fleet passes through that waterway, there will inevitably be disruptions to global supply chains due to the rerouting,” said James Char, an associate research fellow at Singapore’s\n",
      "S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.‘Incredibly busy waterway’ Even a small disruption in global supply chains, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, could prove costly.“China’s planned live-fire exercises are occurring in an incredibly busy waterway,” Nick Marro, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s lead analyst for global trade, wrote in a note.“The shutting down of these transport routes – even temporarily – has consequences not only for Taiwan, but also trade flows tied to Japan and South Korea.”The uncertainty dragged the Taiwan Taiex Shipping and Transportation Index, which\n",
      "tracks major shipping and airline stocks, down 1.05 percent on Thursday.The index was down 4.6 percent since the beginning of the week.Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau has warned ships in northern, eastern and southern areas to avoid the areas being used for the drills.But several shipping companies contacted by AFP said they were waiting to see the impact of the drills before rerouting.The ongoing typhoon season made it riskier to divert ships around the eastern coast of Taiwan through the Philippine Sea, some added.Others said they would stick to their schedules.“We don’t see any impact during (this) period and we don’t have any plan on re-routing our vessels,” said Bonnie Huang, a spokesman for Maersk China.The drills have also hit air routes.Over the last two days, more than 400 flights were cancelled at major airports in Fujian, the Chinese province closest to Taiwan, signalling that the airspace could be used by the military.Taiwan’s cabinet meanwhile, has said the exercises would disrupt 18 international routes passing through its flight information region (FIR).Aggressive posturingDuring the previous Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s, China conducted military exercises for months, including lobbing missiles into waters off Taiwan and rehearsing amphibious assaults on the island.“The Chinese undoubtedly wanted to demonstrate resolve in ways that went beyond what they did in 1996,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at the US-based German Marshall Fund think tank.China’s Global Times newspaper said Wednesday the drills were aimed at showing that China’s military is “capable of blockading the entire island”.But China’s ongoing economic woes mean it is unlikely to risk a major disruption and would limit itself to aggressive posturing, analysts said.“Closing off traffic through the Strait for any extended period of time will also hurt the Chinese economy,” Char said.“It’s not in Beijing’s interest to interrupt civilian travel and trade in the region,” said Natasha Kassam of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.The extent to which China will escalate its response to the Pelosi visit – flexing its military muscle, cyber-attacks and economic sanctions – remains to be seen.Given its military advances, “China very likely has the ability to enforce an air and maritime blockade against Taiwan,” said Thomas Shugart, an expert at US think tank the Center for a New American Security.“Whether China will choose to attempt such a blockade… is largely a matter of how much political and economic risk the Chinese Communist Party’s leaders are willing to incur.”\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501126003/covid-19-cash-transfer-scheme-cut-poverty-finds-undp-study/\n",
      "About 92 per cent of the households receiving money under the Covid-19 Cash Transfer Programme in Cambodia spent it on food, found a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study jointly undertaken with the General Secretariat for the National Social Protection Council, recently, indicating that the scheme, running for over two years, substantially contributed to addressing poverty during the pandemic.Meanwhile, considering the continued impact of the pandemic on vulnerable households, the government is planning to extend the programme, launched on June 24, 2020 by Prime Minister Hun Sen, beyond 2022.As per the earlier plan, the programme, implemented with the support UNDP, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, was to end next month.The programme has supported nearly 70,000 households who are among the poorest and the most vulnerable, the impact assessment study undertaken with a sample size of 1,000 beneficiaries said. The government dishes out an average of around $35 million a month for the programme.The macroeconomic modelling of the study also suggested that the programme helped to stimulate GDP growth by 0.55 percent in 2020 and 0.45 percent in 2021, reduce poverty rate by 2.7 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2021, and reduce unemployment rate by 0.57 percent in 2020 and 0.62 percent in 2021.The study found that on an average a household received about $50 a month under the programme and spent around $37 on food, meaning 92 of them spent up to three-quarters of the cash they received only on food. The remaining spent money on medicine, utility payments, education, clothing, savings, social or religious event etc. in that order.As many as 99 percent of the recipients were satisfied with the current cash transfer mechanism, and when asked for their preference, around 92 percent chose cash over other support.More than 75 percent of the respondents also reported that women are the main decision-makers on household expenses. It was also found that the cash transfer scheme beneficiaries are less likely to take additional loans or drop out of schools.The study also recommended that financial literacy needs to be raised among the cash recipients, particularly when it comes to the relationship with financial service providers. It further suggested that the government continue the programme during the Covid-19 recovery period.UNDP officer-in-charge for Cambodia, Sonali Dayaratne, emphasized the importance of the evidence presented by the new report that investments in social protection can effectively support the most vulnerable. “The impacts the programme has had on their lives are essential building blocks for a more inclusive social protection system in Cambodia,” she said, according to a release.Phan Phalla, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, said the results of the study not only illustrate the effectiveness and transparency of the programme implementation but also crystalize the role of social assistance intervention in improving their livelihood and stimulating the economy.\n",

      "Beijing (AFP) – China rolled out curbs Wednesday on the import of fruit and fish from Taiwan while halting shipments of sand to the island in the wake of a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The trip by Pelosi, who is second in line to the presidency and the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, has ignited a diplomatic firestorm.She landed late Tuesday in the wake of increasingly stark warnings from China, which considers the island a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary.China’s Customs Administration said Wednesday it would suspend some citrus fruit imports from Taiwan over alleged “repeated” detection of excessive pesticide residue, and the import of fish owing to positive coronavirus tests on packages.In a separate notice, the Commerce Ministry added it would also “suspend the export of natural sand to Taiwan” from Wednesday, without providing details.Natural sand is generally used for producing concrete and asphalt, and most of Taiwan’s imported sand and gravel comes from China.The moves are part of a “common pattern for Beijing”, said Even Pay, an agriculture analyst at consultancy Trivium China.More disruptions of agricultural and food trade can be expected in the coming days, she added.“When diplomatic or trade tensions are running high, Chinese regulators typically take an extremely strict approach to compliance… looking for any issues that can be used to justify a trade ban,” she told AFP.China is Taiwan’s biggest trading partner and export market, with bilateral trade growing 26 percent on-year to $328 billion in 2021, official data shows.It is not the first time Beijing has taken aim at the island’s exports.China banned pineapple imports in March 2021, citing the discovery of pests, in a move that was widely seen as politically driven.Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, as she views the island as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of “one China”.On top of the latest bans, Taipei’s Council of Agriculture said Tuesday that China had cited regulatory breaches in suspending the import of other Taiwanese goods, including fishery products, tea and honey.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities also announced planned live-fire military drills encircling Taiwan, in a move Taipei’s defence ministry said threatened key ports and urban areas.At some points, the zone of Chinese operations will come within 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) of Taiwan’s shoreline, according to coordinates shared by the People’s Liberation Army.Taiwan’s 23 million people have long lived with the possibility of an invasion, but that threat has intensified under President Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation. \n",
