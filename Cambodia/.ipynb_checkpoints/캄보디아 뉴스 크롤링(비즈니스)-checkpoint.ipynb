      "August 17, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501133080/despite-risks-gdt-collection-grows-28-62-in-7-months/\n",
      "Tax authorities have collected approximately $2.21 billion of tax revenue — 78.39 percent of the budget law in the first seven months of the year, which soared by 28.62 percent or about $491.29 million compared to the same period last year, said a release by the General Department of Taxation (GDT) on Monday.Cambodia has been facing risks of uncertainties, changes in the global economic context, waves of continuous spreading and transforming of Covid-19, and tensions of geopolitics and global security that have been affecting the country’s economy, the release said.However, despite all of these risks, GDT has still been able to manage the tax revenue over the last two years from 2020 to 2021 and the first seven months of 2022 effectively—rising the amount that exceeds the budget law and responding to the demand for cash for expenditures of the government.GDT collected about $240 million of all kinds of taxes via its revenue data online management system in July 2022 alone—8.49 percent of the budget law—and the amount collected rose by about 20 percent or $156.15 million compared to the same month of 2021, Kong Vibol, director general of GDT said.“The continued rising tax revenue was made from general collection activities of the officials and filling the loopholes that let the revenue leaked out as the tax authorities have continued enhancing good governance, good administration and pro-activeness, especially in preparation, development and launch of information systems since the pre-pandemic period,” the release stated.Tax officials have visited 784 enterprises in Beung Kak 1 quarter of Tuol Kork district since the move was undertaken early this month, according to the release, adding that they also solved over 16,000 cases of problems regarding using online system and applications in the January-July period of this year—2,307 cases in July alone.GTD which operates under the Ministry of Economy and Finance is set to collect over $2.8 billion for 2022 as a whole, the release said, adding that the tax officials will continue visiting businesses in all 14 districts, strengthening the management of enterprises whose owners request for suspension or termination but then reopening.“Prepare tax retreat on implementation of strategic and executive plans of tax collection strategies and utilising information technology system. Continue strengthening recording and settling tax debts and releasing strict measures to claim tax debts, especially large tax debts that are potentially prioritised,” the release pointed out.Stamp tax on transfers of immovable properties—a category of tax paid when an immovable property is acquired through various forms including sale-and-purchase, exchange, gift, or succession—contributed about $875 million or 44.38 percent, which was the biggest contributor to the total tax revenue of approximately $1.2 billion in the first half of this year.Khun Darith, managing partner of accounting and tax solutions at accountancy firm K Professional Accounts (KPA), told Khmer Times that transfers of immovable properties could be made with either hard or soft titles and the stamp tax on transfers is generally paid at four percent of the immovable property price specified in the list of tax authorities.“The contribution of stamp tax on transfers of immovable properties reflects that there may be many transactions of sale-purchase of immovable properties,” said Darith, adding that the exception for payment of the tax is for acquisition among blood family such as transfers from parents to children.\n",

      "August 17, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501133081/govt-likely-to-hike-special-loan-to-rice-sector/\n",
      "The government’s special fund through the Agriculture and Rural Development Bank to the rice sector is expected to witness an increase to help further promote rice production.Chan Seiha, deputy director-general of the Agriculture and Rural Development Bank, said that the bank has disbursed $80 million loan to the rice sector this year.The one-year-period loan has contributed to the development of the rice sector in Cambodia, Seiha said.Since 2016, the amount of emergency loans to the rice sector has increased from $27 million to $80 million in 2022, he said.“The government is expected to provide additional loans to enhance and further develop the rice sector to boost economic growth in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis,” Seiha added.The government’s special financing project has made a significant contribution, especially to the spread of Covid 19 to improve people’s livelihoods and provide food stocks in the current crisis.“For rice exports through low-interest loans, this is a contribution to cost reduction for many rice millers owners,” he said.The loan, with a maturity date of a year period, is offered to rice millers with lower interest rates than commercial banks.The loans are part of a lending mechanism initiated by the government in 2016 to help millers who are short on cash buy paddy rice from farmers and keep the price of the commodity stable.The loan is also designed for helping rice millers expand their silo and warehouses for rice production.The ARDB has called rice millers in need of capital to apply for government emergency loans for the upcoming harvest season.Lun Yeng, secretary-general of the Cambodia Rice Federation, applauded the move, saying that a package of special loan is the government’s effort to help lift the rice sector.“Providing lower interest rate loans to rice millers to collect paddy rice from farmers, to expand rice mills and silo facilities are help from the government to improve the sector in Cambodia,” Yeng said.Cambodia exported 327,000 tonnes of milled rice in the first semester this year, an increase of 16 percent compared to the same period last year, earning the country $279 million, according to a\n",
      "report by the Cambodia Rice Federation.China remained the Kingdom’s biggest export market for milled rice export during the period, the report said, citing that the export accounted for 51.43 percent of the total milled rice export, showing a 17.44 percent increase.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501133082/global-economic-crisis-hurts-rubber-exports/\n",
      "Global economic crisis, rising inflation, interest rate hikes in the United States, the Russia-Ukraine war, the geopolitical situation involving US and China, and a partial shutdown in China adversely affected rubber exports in Cambodia in the first seven months of this year, a top official said.Cambodia’s revenue from dry rubber exports in the first seven months of this year dropped six percent to $254.8 million compared to the same period in the previous year.According to a General Directorate of Rubber (GDR) report, the country exported 161,562 tonnes of dry rubber in the January-July period, a decrease of 0.3 percent when compared with the same period in 2021.Him Aun, GDR director-general, told Khmer Times that the main export countries during the period were Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan and Korea.“The adverse scenario globally has pushed up raw material and energy prices,” he pointed out.When asked about the likely performance of Cambodia in rubber exports in the remaining months of this year, he said, “In my view, the daily income will increase due to increased harvest area, production and consumption. According to a report from the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC), global production reached 1.113 million tonnes by June 2022, an increase of 3.8 percent over the same period in 2021. Similarly, global consumption projected a faster growth at 5.8 percent amounting to 1.206 million tonnes during the same reference period.”On the current challenges being faced by the rubber industry in the country, he said, “The rubber market is unstable because we rely on exports. Besides many youngsters prefer to stop farming and concentrate on other industries and services for jobs.” The country has so far planted rubber trees on a total area of 404,044 hectares, of which 310,193 hectares, or 77 percent, are old enough to be tapped, according to the GDR report.“A ton of dry rubber averagely cost $1,577 during the first seven months of 2022, about $95 lower than that of the same period last year,” Oun said.The Kingdom exported 366,300 tonnes of rubber latex in 2021, an increase of eight percent compared to the export figures in 2020. The country also earned more than $610 million from exports last year.In its June natural rubber (NR) Statistical Report, The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC), said the outlook of the NR market is expected to improve further during this year in production and consumption. Based on the estimates given by member governments up to June 2022, the association provided the outlook for the rest of the year.It pointed out that despite the favourable market fundamental in the NR market, the market sentiments were driven by various factors namely the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China, recovery outlook from the rising raw material and energy costs, worries over inflationary pressure and interest hikes from tightening monetary policy imposed by central banks, uncertainties from geopolitical conflicts between Russia and Ukraine.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501133083/oil-prices-extend-losses-in-asia-equities-rise/\n",
      "AFP – Oil prices extended losses Tuesday after weak US and Chinese data reinforced recession expectations, though equities won support from hopes the figures will allow central banks to temper their pace of interest rate hikes.Stock traders tracked a Wall Street advance led by tech firms thanks to an increase in bets that the Federal Reserve will not lift borrowing costs by 75 basis points for a third straight meeting next month.Both main crude contracts dropped in early Asian business, having lost around three percent the day before, as demand expectations are lowered in light of a string of soft economic indicators in major economies.Signs that Iran is moving towards a nuclear deal added to the downward pressure on prices, with an agreement seen allowing the country to restart sales into the world market.Analysts said Tehran could provide 2.5 million barrels a day, giving a much-needed shot in the arm to supplies, which have been hammered by sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.Libya has also boosted production, helping prices drop to six-month lows and wiping out the gains seen after the Ukraine war started.But analysts warned that there might still be some way to go on an Iran agreement owing to upcoming US elections.“A deal with Iran would likely not be popular with US voters and so is hard to envisage before the November mid-terms,” said National Australia Bank’s Ray Attrill.“Markets are currently prone to optimism, though, and hopes for a deal… have added to downward pressure on oil prices.”With surging oil prices a key driver of inflation to multi-decade highs around the world, the drop has fanned hopes that the headline figure could begin to come down.That has led to speculation that central bank chiefs could lift rates at a slower pace, and then think about pivoting monetary policy to cuts as early as next year.The prospect of a less painful hiking campaign has sparked a rally in equities from their June lows.And on Tuesday, Asia built on Wall Street’s upbeat performance.Hong Kong and Shanghai rose after Beijing cut rates Monday as the world’s number two economy struggles to recover from a plunge in activity caused by extended Covid lockdowns.Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila, Jakarta and Wellington were also up, though Tokyo was flat and Singapore dipped.Still, analysts warned that while equities are enjoying a bounce, the economic outlook could keep them subdued or even fall back again.“The risk of the markets going below the June lows is quite high,” Shane Oliver, at AMP Services, told Bloomberg Television. The weak data presage “weaker earnings growth ahead in the US”, he added.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501133084/mining-giant-bhp-records-decade-high-profit-buoyed-by-coal/\n",
      "AFP – Australian mining firm BHP revealed Tuesday that its profits jumped nearly 40 percent in the past year despite falling iron ore prices, bolstered by unprecedented demand for coal and copper.The company recorded US$23.8 billion in underlying attributable profit after a busy year in which it completed a merger with petroleum giant Woodside.BHP’s stellar results – which will see shareholders paid a full-year dividend of US$3.25 per share – outpaced analysts’ expectations as many others in the mining sector face tough times.Rival miner Rio Tinto recently reported that its profits fell sharply in the past year and halved its dividend.BHP’s coal business drove its strong results, with both metallurgical and energy coal prices hitting record levels after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Copper was also a boon to the company’s fortunes, despite some recent price drops.“These strong results were due to safe and reliable operations, project delivery and capital discipline, which allowed us to capture the value of strong commodity prices,” BHP chief executive Mike Henry said.However, BHP warned conditions may soon cool: “Growth momentum has slowed across many key regions, and caution remains due to geopolitical uncertainty as well as COVID-19.”It pointed to advanced economies in particular, where many central banks are trying to rein in inflation.“We expect to see a slowdown in advanced economies as monetary policy tightens, as well as ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and inflationary pressures,” Henry said.BHP also revealed in its results that the impact of Covid-19 on its operations was US$1.5 billion, largely due to constraints on labour and supply. \n",

      "Braving the rain threat, people have resumed travelling across the country thanks to the resumption of socio-economic activities and effective measures to control the Covid-19 situation in Cambodia.A total of 233,933 national and international visitors travelled across the Kingdom during the second weekend of August.Around 212,313 were national visitors while 21,620 have been internal foreign tourists who travelled through different places in the country on August 13 and 14, according to the Ministry of Tourism.Considering the incessant rainfall, strong winds and floods in the Kingdom last week, the figures indicated revival signs for domestic tourism.The Siem Reap cultural province remained the top destination for visitors due to the presence of the world-famous Angkor Wat.The other places that tourists found attractive last weekend were Preah Sihanouk, Kampot, Battambang and Kampong Speu provinces. The capital city Phnom Penh also attracted travellers during the second weekend of this month. Kep, Pursat and Kandal provinces have also been ranked among the nine most attractive destinations.While Siem Reap attracted 38,249 tourists, Preah Sihanouk received 31,589 travellers, followed by Kampot (23,819), Battambang (21,177), Kampong Speu (18,826), Phnom Penh (18,359) and Kep (12,720). However, the figures from the first weekend of this month showed a total of 246,195 people travelling across the country.The increase in numbers was due to the hosting of the 55th Asean Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and other related events during the first week of August in Cambodia. Many ministers and their delegations used the occasion to visit some of the popular tourist destinations in the country.At the same time, the Kingdom received more than 220,000 tourists at the last weekend of July.Meanwhile, some reports indicated that the Ministry of Tourism is discussing with other ministries, institutions and the private sector the possibility of forming special tour packages to attract more travellers to the country. The government recently announced a plan to develop six tourism zones, including Preah Jayavarman-Norodom National Park or Kulen Mountain, surrounding areas of Bateay Srey Protected Area, Angkor Heritage Site, Siem Reap City, Tonle Sap Lake Area and New Siem Reap Tourist Site.Last month, tourism minister Thong Khon said that the Kingdom expects to attract one million international tourists this year.The country received 510,000 foreign visitors in the first half of this year, a whooping increase of 394 percent compared to the same period last year.Vietnam and Thailand were the largest sources of tourists to the country.Tourism, one of the four pillars supporting the Kingdom’s economy, is forecast to reach its pre-Covid level in 2026 or 2027.In the pre-pandemic era, Cambodia received 6.6 million international tourists in 2019, generating $4.92 billion in revenue.\n",

      "The year 2022 could be the beginning of a long recovery for Cambodian tourism, though it would still be a far cry from 6.6 million international tourists the Kingdom received in pre-pandemic 2019, Director General of Tourism Development and International Cooperation of the Ministry of Tourism Thong Rathasak tells Khmer TimesRecovering fast from the Covid-19 downfall, Cambodia is banking on increased arrival of foreign tourists this year, compared to the last two years. The expectation of the Ministry of Tourism is that the country could receive 1.2 to 1.3 million tourists by the end of 2022.This year could be the beginning of a long recovery for Cambodian tourism, though it would still be a far cry from the 6.6 million international tourists the country received in pre-pandemic 2019, said Thong Rathasak, Director General of Tourism Development and International Cooperation of the Ministry of Tourism, in an exclusive interview with Khmer Times.According to Rathasak, Cambodia has received more than 500,000 tourists in the first six months of the year and this is a good comeback compared to the 200,000 tourist arrivals last year.“Covid-19 was a big lesson as we learned to coexist with a pandemic. Tourism is a way of life here and we have to move on,” he said, hoping that people who left the tourism sector would come back and rebuild their businesses or careers.For Cambodia, the Year 2022 started well as it got the chance to organise the Asean Tourism Forum (ATF), which was attended by 3,000 delegates from different parts of the region. Held in Sihanoukville, the forum was not only a big success but concluded with no cases of Covid-19 as well.“It was the first major tourism event in the region in three years and was a great success,” Rathasak noted, adding that Cambodia was the first country that reopened after the Covid-19 shutdown in the region and the country’s successful vaccination campaign had contributed a lot to the economic revival.The government also got into the act of boosting the tourism sector revival with various incentives, the latest being the Tourism Recovery Co-Financing Scheme, launched on July 1, for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) where an entrepreneur could avail up to $400,000 for rebuilding the business. The government has set up a $150 million fund for the scheme, of which $75 million is borne by the government and the remaining $75 million by the participating financial institutions.Next year could also make a lot of difference to the sector as Cambodia will host the South East Asia (SEA) Games in May and the Para Games in June. “We are expecting half-a-million people to visit Cambodia during the SEA Games,” said Rathasak. The country will also open three more airports by the next year.The Director General, however, noted that the revival of tourism in the Asia Pacific region depends to a great extent on the three big players – China, Japan and Korea that account for 60 percent of tourist footfalls. While China is yet to fully reopen due to its ‘Zero Covid-19’ policy, Japan and Korea are currently battling a new wave of pandemic.According to Rathasak, the ministry is also keen on boosting domestic tourism in Cambodia. “This is in fact the best time for domestic tourists to explore the country,” he said, adding that there are lots of hidden tourism gems across the Kingdom to be explored.“Development of infrastructure is needed in some of the remote tourism spots. But people are also attracted to virgin destinations,” he noted, adding that September is when a lot of activities are expected, especially in connection with the World Tourism Day celebrations.In December, Sihanoukville will host the Sea Festival and coinciding with the year-end tourism, this can turn out to be a game changer for the sector. “The focus in Sihanoukville is no more gambling, but gaming. The island excursions are the added attractions in the coastal city,” he said.Cambodia, he said, is also banking on increased tourist arrivals from neighbouring Asean countries as well. The Southern Tourism Corridor Cooperation, participated by Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos besides Cambodia could encourage more tourists from these countries to visit Cambodia.The cooperation could also result in more self-driving tours from the neighbouring countries. Cambodia, meanwhile, also sees cruise tourism as an emerging opportunity. “We expect one million tourists by the sea in 2026,” Rathasak said.A water link connecting Vietnam’s Phu Quoc island with Cambodia’s Kep province is also under the consideration of the government. “The government is working on this as it involves foreign policy as well. We also need to set up immigration posts,” he noted.Cambodia will also attend the International Travel Expo (ITE HCMC) 2022 in Ho Chi Minh City from September 6-11 and the Mekong Tourism Forum (MTF) from October 11-14 in the Vietnamese\n",
      "city of Hoi An.While Angkor Wat continues to be the tourist icon for Cambodia, being a UNESCO world heritage site, the country is also focussing on promoting other centres such Battambang, Kampot and Sihanoukville.While Battambang is considered the UNESCO greatest city network, the delicious Nom Banh Chok of Cambodia can also get into the endangered or protected list of heritage by the world body.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also gearing up to launch the book, Taste of Angkor, through Cambodian embassies across the world. “It is estimated that tourists spend around 25 percent of the total expenditure on food. And, if you want to taste authentic Cambodian cuisine you have to come to the country,” Rathasak said.Asked about the recent discussions about a long pass for foreign tourists to visit Angkor Wat, the Director General said it was yet to be approved by the government.Regarding foreign investment in tourism, he said the sector has received around 600 million worth of investments this year. “The government is also working on a Special Tourism Economic Zone to attract more foreign investment and a host of incentives can be expected for setting up projects in the zone,” he said.The tourism ministry is also keen on enhancing the quality of human resources in the sector. There are not many schools in the country having a tourism curriculum. “We are considering the proposal to set up a university exclusively for tourism studies,” Rathasak said. \n",

      "Cambodia’s national council on minimum wage on Monday began to discuss the annual increase of monthly minimum wage for the garment, footwear and travel goods industry for 2023, according to a statement from the council.The first of a series of meetings was participated by Labor and Vocational Training Minister Ith Samheng, representative of the government, Nang Sothy, deputy representative of the employers, and Kim Chansamnang, deputy representative of the employees, the statement said.During the meeting, the council presented key statistical updates on socio-economic criteria to form the basis for the 2023 minimum wage talks, it said, adding that the council also received input such as current inflation, competition and market situation from the representatives of employers and employees.According to the statement, the representatives of employers and employees have not proposed their respective specific figures for the negotiations yet as they need further internal discussions.“The next meetings will be held on Aug. 24 and 31 and Sept. 7, 14, 22 and 23 at the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training,” the statement said.The garment, footwear and travel goods sector, the kingdom’s largest foreign currency earner, consists of about 1,100 factories and branches with around 750,000 workers, according to the ministry.The Southeast Asian nation exported relevant products worth $6.6 billion during the first half of this year, up 40 percent from the same period last year, according to the General Department of Customs and Excise.The monthly minimum wage for the sector is $194  in 2022, an increase from $192 in 2021; however, workers have got fringe benefits such as a transport and housing allowance of $7 and a regular attendance bonus of $10 per month.

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501132523/cambodian-womens-job-prospects-hit-by-pandemic-study/\n",
      "The employment prospects of women and girls, who are overrepresented in economic sectors like the garment industry and tourism in Cambodia, have been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says a study conducted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).A case study titled ‘Valuing and investing in unpaid care and domestic work’, observed that women and girls in the country are especially vulnerable in the face of this economic reversal.According to the report, as much as 60 percent of the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises had been owned by women in the country. They are often not formally registered and hence unable to avail themselves of government benefits. The report called for a strong focus on gender-responsive policy measures to address the situation.“In conjunction with women’s greater share of unpaid care and domestic work within households, it is imperative for the country to keep a strong focus on gender-responsive policy measures to tackle the setbacks from the pandemic as well as to accelerate women’s participation in and contribution to the economy,” the report noted.“The prime minister’s address on International Women’s Day on 8 March 2022 highlighted the theme of ‘Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow’. He underscored the crucial importance of all stakeholders, including the private sector, in recognising the value of unpaid care work and thus identifying ways to reduce the workload of women and girls while increasing public investment in care and social welfare services,” the report said.As Cambodia assumes the role of Asean chair and leads the second Asean Women Leaders’ Summit in 2022, this message reaffirms the government’s commitment to gender equality and the critical role of women in leadership, it noted.The study further observed that despite the impressive economic performance over the past few decades, Cambodia continues to lag behind its Asean neighbours in terms of progress towards gender equality.“The Gender Development Index, prepared as part of the UNDP Human Development Index 2020, ranks Cambodia in group 4, which is medium-to-low gender equality between men and women.” It said the female labour force participation (76.9 percent) is one of the highest in the Asean region, alongside the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, but it still lags that of men (at 87.7 percent).“Despite the high female labour force participation, the gender wage gap prior to the pandemic was 19 percent. The high participation rate of women in paid work must be kept in perspective, with the fact that 93.8 per cent of these women are engaged in informal employment. This means that women are subject to precarious work conditions, low wages and the lack of social security benefits on account of self employment or being employed as domestic workers,” read the report.Women are also underrepresented in senior managerial positions in the private sector. “They account for 29.3 percent of migrant workers, with a major flow towards Thailand. Availability of time and access to resources, finance, IT are some of the other barriers to women’s full and effective participation in an economic capacity,” the report said.\n",

      "The Agriculture and Rural Development Bank of the Ministry of Economy and Finance has signed the $30 million subsidiary loan agreement with three banks and micro-financial institutions to help financial access to the agricultural sector.The agreement was signed yesterday by its director-general Kao Thach, Kea Boran, CEO of AMK microfinance, Touch Chao Chek, CEO of Cambodia Post Bank Plc, and Yannick Nicolas MILEV, CEO of Chamreoun microfinance.The subsidiary loan agreement is under the Cambodia Agricultural Sector Diversification Project (CASDP) financed by the World Bank.The agreement is aimed at promoting financial inclusion and supporting production chains and agricultural sector diversification in targeted 13 capital/provinces – Phnom Penh, Battambang, Mondulkiri, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri, Preah Vihear, Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum, Kratie, Siem Reap, Kandal, Kampong Speu and Kampong Chhnang.Under the $30 million subsidiary loan agreement, the signed banks and MFIs will provide loans with an annual interest rate of 5 percent for farmers, small and medium enterprises, agricultural cooperatives and producers for all agricultural products except rice.The agreement will contribute to financial service to farmers enhancing their agricultural production, Thach said. “It will contribute to the government is continuing to provide loans to farmers in need, especially farmers who face difficulties in the Covid 19 time so that they can use the financial resources to develop production,” he said.“Cooperation with private sector banks now is to improve the lives of farmers,” Thach added.According to the World Bank report, Cambodia’s agricultural sector contributed about one-quarter of annual GDP and was the source of 3.1 million jobs in 2016.Nearly 46.3 percent or 3 million rural people still rely on agriculture for employment. The sector has experienced very little growth, raising concerns about its underlying strength, competitiveness and its ability to continue to provide sustainable livelihoods.The CASDP was established with financial backing from the World Bank to address these issues of lack the knowledge, skills, and access to modern inputs and processing techniques to successfully commercialise agricultural output.Veng Sakhon, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries in July spoke highly of the good cooperation between the ministry and CASDP team.“The project will contribute positively to the development of agriculture in Cambodia,” he said.The export of non-rice agricultural exports from January to May amounted to 3.23 million tonnes, inching up by 0.13 million tonnes from a year earlier – valued at nearly $1.4 billion, the ministry’s report showed.\n",

      "Boosting job prospects in the garment and yarn sectors of the country, three new investment projects with a total capital of $15.7 million are set to start their operations in Cambodia.The Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) said in a statement that it has approved the new projects in Kampong Speu province and Phnom Penh.The newly approved garment and yarn factories are Jade Fashion (Cambodia) Garments Company Limited, Hong Yu Fang Garment Co., Ltd., and Shun Wei Fang Zhi Ke Ji Co., Ltd.According to estimates, the projects would help create around 2,279 jobs for the people in the country.Garment, footwear and travel goods industry is the largest foreign exchange earner for the Kingdom. The sector consists of around 1,100 factories and branches, employing close to 750,000 workers, mostly female.According to the release, Jade Fashion plans to establish a garment tailoring factory in Phnom Penh, while Hong Yu Fang’s garment tailoring unit is scheduled to be opened in Kampong Speu province.Meanwhile, Shun Wei Fang’s yarn production factory would also be based in Kampong Speu province.In the first week of this month, CDC approved five investment projects worth $26.3 million, with the potential to generate a total of 4,192 jobs for the locals.The five projects were related to the production of clothes, shoe accessories, solar panels, wardrobes, etc, a CDC release pointed out. The factories will be based in Phnom Penh and the provinces of Preah Sihanouk and Kampong Speu.According to experts, the steady increase in investment projects is a clear indication of the country’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic’s adverse effects. A report earlier this month showed that the country’s garment, footwear and travel goods industry posted a 40 percent increase in exports in the first half of 2022.The Kingdom exported products worth $6.6 billion during the January-June period in 2022, compared to exports valued at $4.72 billion for the same period last year.The Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman Penn Sovicheat attributed the growth to the full resumption of socio-economic activities in the country, free trade agreements, and a rise in global demand.“The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement, which entered into force in January, has also contributed to this growth,” he said.RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 Asean member states —  Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and their five trading partners — China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.A recent report from the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation said Cambodia has 1,947 active factories as of July this year with a total investment of $15 billion and created a million jobs for local people.\n",

      "In the first seven months of the year, Cambodia exported 670,000 tonnes of raw cashew nuts to Vietnam worth over $1 million, a decrease of more than 37 percent compared to the same period last year, according to a report by the Cashew Nuts Association of Cambodia (CAC).Uon Siloth, president of CAC, told Khmer Times that due to bad weather conditions the yield had gone down and the farmers could not meet the demand from Vietnam.In the first seven months of 2021, Vietnam imported more than one million tonnes of cashew nuts from Cambodia. Vietnam is Cambodia’s largest market for cashew nuts.“Due to the weather our cashew nuts were badly damaged,” he pointed out, adding that the Vietnamese side also reduced purchases.The price of cashew nuts also fell, selling between 550 riels and 720 riels per kg.He said the yield will go down further as some farmers have already abandoned cashew cultivation. “According to the cashew plantation data in 2021, we had 800,000 hectares nationwide. But now this has come down to 70,000 hectares,” he said.Besides Vietnam, Cambodia exports cashew nuts to China, Japan, Laos and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The Ministry of Commerce and relevant institutions are now looking to speed up the preparation of the draft National Policy on Cashew Nuts for 2022-2027.Key objectives of the policy include reinforcing Cambodia’s capacity to grow, store, process, package, market, distribute and export cashew nuts and derived products and establishing the Kingdom as a major producer and supplier regionally and beyond.Ministry of Commerce has instructed the institutions, development partners and private sector actors to keep pooling resources and pick up the pace of work on the six-year policy, to address some of the troubles dogging the sector today.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501132350/deposit-holders-to-benefit-from-rising-interest-rates-abc/\n",
      "Deposit holders are expected to benefit from interest rate hikes by banks and microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDIs), according to a senior official at the Association of Banks in Cambodia (ABC).Phal Chalm Theany, Secretary General of ABC, explained in an email to Khmer Times that rising inflation, mostly resulting from low-interest rates over the last years, is now materialising alongside rising interest rates.“Interest rates are most likely to go up over the next months as central banks around the world have started raising rates to counter inflation. Such increase in rates may also benefit deposit holders as banks and MDIs are now paying higher interest rates,” Theany said.Currently, there are about 13.2 million deposit accounts and 3.5 million credit accounts at the country’s banks and microfinance institutions, according to Cambodia’s central bank National Bank of Cambodia (NBC).The average per-annum interest rate for deposits in Khmer riel has increased faster than that in dollars by 0.6 percent to 6.2 percent in 2021 from 5.6 percent in 2020, while the interest rate for deposits in dollars has risen by 0.4 percent to 4.7 percent from 4.3 percent, according to ABC.Sok Voeun, chairman of Cambodia Microfinance Institution, said recently that many banks and MFIs in Cambodia have increased interest rates for deposits in dollar and riel by approximately 0.5 percent and one percent per annum respectively but not decreased rates for loans in the last three months.In the first half of 2022, there have been 58 commercials, nine specialised banks, six representative offices, five MDIs, 81 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), 17 financial leasing firms, 33 payment service firms, 226 rural credit operators and 2,674 money changers, according to ABC’s data, adding that three banks newly-licensed during the period include Woori Bank, Oriental Bank and CCU Commercial Bank.Banks and MFIs can raise their interest rates for deposits and loans in a free market economy without prior consultations with ABC or NBC as long as the interest rates are correct, for example, not exceeding 18 percent per annum for MFIs, she explained.“Cambodia follows a free market economy. Given that Cambodia is a highly-dollarised economy, Cambodia’s interest rates are largely driven by international developments. Having said that, interest rates in Khmer riel are largely driven by NBC as well as the premise of a stable exchange rate to the dollar,” she explained.ABC figures also show that the average annual interest rate for loans in Khmer riel and US dollar were 6.5 percent and 10.68 percent respectively from 2020 to 2021. The amount of loans and deposits were $44.03 billion — 9.8 percent in Khmer riel and 79.16 percent from banks — and about $36.75 billion respectively from January to June 2022.Pheany added that as per the forecast by the International Monetary Fund, Cambodia’s economy would grow by 5-6 percent next year, leading to the assumption of an increase in loans. In anticipation of an economic recovery, the banking sector is expected to grow at 20 percent.\n",

      "AFP – Britain’s economy shrank in the second quarter, official data showed Friday, as the country heads towards recession under a new PM.UK gross domestic product dropped 0.1 percent in the April-June period after a rise of 0.8 percent in the first quarter, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement.The Bank of England (BoE) expects the economy to enter a year-long recession by the end 2022 as Britons endure a cost-of-living crisis with inflation at its highest level in decades.“With May’s growth revised down a little and June showing a notable fall, overall the economy shrank slightly in the second quarter,” said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.“Health was the biggest reason the economy contracted as both the (Covid) test and trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter.”New PM Following Friday’s data, finance  minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was “determined to work with the BoE to get inflation under control and grow the economy”.But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not make “major fiscal interventions” before leaving office next month, his spokesman said on Monday amid calls for immediate government action to tackle Britain’s cost-of-living crisis.Johnson, who last month announced he would step down on September 6 following a slew of scandals, is set to hand power to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak after a Conservative leadership battle.Foreign Secretary Truss and Sunak have clashed over how to address the crisis. Truss plans an emergency budget to lower taxes and to review the independent BoE’s inflation-fighting mandate.But Sunak said tax cuts financed with more borrowing would force the bank to increase interest rates, even more, insisting on the need to maintain fiscal rigour and tame the price pressures first.\n",

      "Improving the connectivity between Cambodia and India is key to the growing trade relations between the two, said Devyani Khobragade, India’s Ambassador to the Kingdom, yesterday. She was speaking to Khmer Times after hoisting the Indian national flag at the embassy to mark the 75th anniversary of the country’s independence.The ambassador said India’s relationship with Cambodia can be dated back several centuries and a shared culture is proof of the historical ties. “India is highly regarded in Cambodia. Cambodian people are also loved in India. The people-to-people contact has been there always. We want to leverage the cultural links to enhance economic relations as well. This can be achieved by improving the connectivity – through air, road, water and even via digital technology,” she said.On the proposal to extend the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway to Cambodia, she said this is under serious consideration. “We want to bring more people from India to Cambodia and will also encourage more Cambodians to visit India,” she said.Earlier this month, during a visit to Cambodia, India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called for speeding up road connectivity from the northeast of India to Vietnam through Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.According to some estimates, there are around 4,000 Indians living in Cambodia. This year also marks the 70th anniversary of Cambodia-India diplomatic relations.Meanwhile, the ambassador added that the trade between India and Cambodia has shown an improvement in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year.“To further improve the trade and connectivity is going to be our focus now,” she said, adding that India does not see the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), to which Cambodia is a party, as a threat to the bilateral trade between the two countries.A recent report by Cambodia’s Ministry of Commerce showed that in 2021 the total trade volume between the Kingdom and India stood at $311 million. While Cambodia exported more than $126 million worth of goods to India, exports from India to Cambodia had reached $185 million.Meanwhile, Cambodia’s government is also studying the possibility of having a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India.In fact, at a virtual meeting with his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen in May this year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the historical and civilisational links between the two countries and also expressed his happiness at India’s involvement in the restoration of Angkor Wat and Preah Vihear temples.India also wanted to boost the cooperation with Cambodia in the Asean and Mekong-Ganga frameworks in the areas of economic ties, tourism, defence, mine clearance, investment, community development and temple restoration.Hun Sen had requested India to promote direct flights to Cambodia to enhance tourism and take the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation framework to the next level.\n",

      "AFP – Japan’s economy expanded in the three months to June, official data showed Monday, after the government lifted Covid-19 curbs on businesses.The world’s third-largest economy grew 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter due to stronger consumption and capital investment, but the rise was below market expectations of 0.7 percent.While the country never imposed strict stay-at-home orders during the pandemic, the government in March removed virus restrictions primarily targeting business opening hours.Inbound tourism remains limited to group tours, however, and the economy is facing headwinds – from the energy price crisis to fears of a global recession fuelled by biting inflation.From April to June, private consumption grew 1.1 percent compared with the 0.3 percent registered in the January-March quarter, according to the data released by the Cabinet Office.Capital spending expanded 1.4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous quarter.“After the government lifted a quasi-state of emergency in late March, consumption of services showed a relatively strong rebound, while capital investment returned to growth,” BNP Paribas said in a note issued before the GDP data.Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting also noted that “as the spread of the Omicron variant subsided, private consumption steadily increased, especially in-person services, and lifted the overall economy.”In May, the Cabinet Office reported that the economy shrank slightly in the first quarter of 2022, but on Monday, this was revised to zero percent. That means no change was observed following a modest rebound in the final quarter of 2021.Consumer prices are rising in Japan, although not at the blistering rate seen in the United States and many other major economies.The Bank of Japan sees the price rises as temporary and is sticking to its long-held monetary easing policies in a bid to achieve stable growth, a decision that has caused the yen to plummet to 24-year lows against the dollar.Supply chain disruption caused by Covid-19 lockdowns in China and sky-high energy costs due to the war in Ukraine has also created a challenging environment for growth.\n",

      "Singaporean owned luxury real estate developer AKRAM Development Co., Ltd acquires over 3.5 hectares of land from OCIC to embark on USD150 million investment\n",
      "August 15, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/1131693/singaporean-owned-luxury-real-estate-developer-akram-development-co-ltd-acquires-over-3-5-hectares-of-land-from-ocic-to-embark-on-usd150-million-investment/\n",
      "Phnom Penh – Singaporean owned luxury real estate developer AKRAM Development Co., Ltd has recently acquired a piece of land measuring more than 3.5 hectares in Koh Norea from Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation (OCIC) for an ultra-luxurious development. The acquisi­tion was signed by Kelvin Chua, CEO of AKRAM Development, Melvin Poh, Director of AKRAM Development, repre­senting the buyers, and Okhna Pung Kheav Se, Chairman of the board of directors of OCIC representing the seller. The total investment by AKRAM Development in the project is estimated to be in excess of USD150 million.During the signing ceremony, AKRAM’s CEO Kelvin Chua said the purpose of this acquisition is to develop a one-of-its-kind ultra-luxury project. “We are seeing an increasing demand in the ultra luxurious segment in the Kingdom,” says Kelvin. “Koh Norea is a highly strategic location, not only does it enjoy the full frontage of Mekong River but it is also adjacent to the landmark locations of Diamond Island and Nagaworld Integrated Resort. We would like to give special thanks to Okhna Pung for entrusting AKRAM for being a part of the exciting commercial and infrastructure blueprint OCIC have for Koh Norea. Located in the most prime location and with a full view of the Mekong river, the future poten­tial of this island is unimaginable.”“The pandemic has encouraged people to pay more attention to their well-being and quality of life; we are confident that our curation will bring a breath of fresh air to Phnom Penh’s property market,” he adds.Kelvin is a long-term Singaporean investor based in Cambodia. The former banker-turned-entrepreneur has a proven track record in multiple industries including property development, design and construc­tion, and manufacturing for over a decade. He is also currently the CEO of SINGBUILD Construction, an esteemed design and build construction company headquartered in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.“As AKRAM’s maiden project, this ultra-luxury development is slated to set a high benchmark as we embark on our journey to becoming the leading luxury property developer in Cambodia,” said the CEO ambitiously. Determined to gain a stronghold in the Cambodia property market, AKRAM Development is a part­nership between Kelvin Chua and Melvin Poh from Centra Group Singapore who possesses a stunning portfolio of over USD1B GDV under his belt.“With more than 20 years of experience specializing in high-end and luxury devel­opment coupled with some of the best architectures and innovative designs, we strongly believe this development will be a disruption to the local luxury property market,” said Melvin, a seasoned property expert in high-end and luxury development.The acquired land on Koh Norea is strategically located in Phnom Penh with approximately 3 minutes drive to the bustling Koh Pich (or more commonly known as Diamond Island) and 5 minutes to Nagaworld Integrated Resort. As part of the infrastructure contributions, OCIC is constructing two connecting bridges with spending in excess of USD38 million for one bridge connecting Diamond Island, and another to National Road 1. The 6-lane bridge to Diamond Island is expected to open by Q3 2023 while the Koh Norea-National Road 1 bridge is slated to be in operation within the next month or two.“Our development is curated for those who appreciate the finest things in life. Our combined strengths and knowledge in the industry will assure the development of unsurpassed quality matched with excep­tional class and privacy,” says Kelvin when he was asked about the target market of the development. “For the project’s superior built quality amid the picturesque million-dollar Mekong River views, this is a great opportunity for investors who are interested to diversify their investment portfolio with an ultra-luxury investment.”While some are skeptical about the economic outlook, both Kelvin and Melvin are confident that this is one of their best investments ever. “We are very bullish on Cambodia market and the opportunity here. Cambodia has been growing impressively with a GDP average growth of 7% for the past two decades. The government has done an exemplary job in attracting foreign inves­tors which resulted in a whopping 14% net contribution of foreign direct investment inflow to the country’s GDP even during the hardest hit of the pandemic in 2020, as compared to only 3.2% to the GDP two decades ago,” says Melvin. “The handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is a good example of how efficient and stable the government is and with pro-foreign investment policies, it is no wonder that the World Bank estimated that Cambodia’s economy will grow by 4.5% just 2022 alone,” further explained by Kelvin.World Bank expects the Kingdom’s economy to continue to grow at around 6% annually moving forward post-covid, with the report attributing the growth to the new investment law and free trade agreements, while Focus Economics ranked Cambodia as the world’s 5th fastest growing economy when the report studied over 130 fastest growing economies over the 2021-2025 period.The 35 year-old young entrepreneur is not satisfied with this pristine acquisition alone as he envisions AKRAM Development to build on the momentum from this purchase. “Location is the most important factor in the luxury property market and we are grateful to have purchased this plot of land from Okhna Pung. The acquisition of the land would not have been so swift without his trust and support in our project. We are happy to be a part of the vision for Koh Norea and strongly believe that the prime location of the land will be a key attraction for our project.”“Our sales gallery and showflat is expected to be ready by Q1 2023. As more things continue to develop, we will announce the gallery location and project details in the coming months,” says Kelvin.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501131702/chinese-firm-prepares-for-ipo-on-cambodias-stock-exchange/\n",
      "A Chinese conglomerate firm has kicked off preparation for the process of raising equity capital from public investors through issuing shares and having them listed for sale for the first time, which is called Initial Public Offering (IPO) on Cambodia Securities Exchange next year, according to the top official of securities regulator.Senior officials of Honchen Group and securities broker Golden Fortune (Cambodia) Securities Plc signed an agreement with each other last Tuesday, which enables the former to commission the latter to proceed with the preparation of documents to fulfill legal requirements, according to the official.Sou Socheat, Director General of Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC), told Khmer Times on Friday that Honchen Group and Golden Fortune signed the deal to form an IPO team that will assist Honchen in the IPO process, especially the preparation of a due diligence report and disclosure document.“They prepare for IPO next year! They signed to establish the IPO team according to the regulator’s rules and regulations. The IPO team will work forward to the company’s listing next year. They will need to submit their IPO plan to SERC, maybe in the next few months,” Socheat added.   Honchen Group will also apply for the public issuance of equity securities to the SERC after eligibility review by the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) with main mandate is to establish and operate a securities market, a clearing and settlement facility, and a depository, in accordance with the Law on Issuance and Trading of Non-Government Securities and its subsequent regulations.Socheat added that Golden Fortune—an securities broker that runs business of acting as an intermediary between sellers and buyers of share listed on a stock exchange or as an agent for a customer and charges the customer a commission for its services—will need to cooperate with RHB Securities (Cambodia) Plc following a deal they have signed to assist Honchen Group to prepare an application for listing eligibility review to CSX.RHB Securities acts as a securities underwriter—a key entity in the IPO process mainly by providing arrangements for the IPO process on behalf of Honchen or participating directly or indirectly in the process, drafting disclosure documents and due diligence reports on pricing, and advice on the number of shares should be listed and timeline for IPO.“They’ve just started the process. No documents have been submitted yet. They need to work with an underwriter first. We welcome the group to our market,” he said, adding that the IPO team that will be formed following the deal signed will work forward to the public listing of Honchen Group in Cambodia — a subsidiary of Honchen (Hong Kong) Holdings Limited — next year.The agreement was signed by Cao Jun, CEO of Honchen Group, and Zhang Lingfeng, Managing Director of Golden Fortune at an inauguration ceremony for gallery building of Platinum Coast in the project’s sales office near Sihanoukville International Airport. The project is the investment joint venture between the multinational company Honchen Group and Lixin Group, according to a release by Lixin Group.These two companies will develop the Platinum Coast Project worth hundreds of million of US dollars on 50 hectares of land to be a world-class giant tourism and leisure spot in Sihanoukville New City of Lixin on 2,500 hectares of land with natural view resources and a beach next to mountains facing to the sea in Sihanoukville.“The company, with encouragement from Cambodia’s securities regulator, has officially started preparation for the public listing and expects to be listed on the stock exchange of the country in the second half of next year,” the release pointed out, adding that, Honchen Group is running businesses in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, US and Malaysia.“The group has businesses in finance, real estate development and management, environment protection, clean energy, trade events, trading, hotels and tourism development that have grown fast domestically and abroad,” the release said.Currently, there are nine listed firms which seven are listed on the Main Board and two on the Growth Board on securities market, according to the securities trading statistical bulletin for the second half of 2022 released by SERC.Seven stocks on the Main Board include state-owned Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority, apparel clothing firm Grand Twins International, state-owned Phnom Penh Autonomous Port, special economic zone Phnom Penh SEZ, state-owned Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, ACLEDA Bank and Pestech. Two stocks on the Growth Board include DBD Engineering and JS Land—latest publicly listed on Growth Board in February 2022.\n",

      "Strong external demand helps Cambodia’s H1 recovery\n",
      "August 15, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501131695/strong-external-demand-helps-cambodias-h1-recovery/\n",
      "The early lifting of Covid-19 restrictions boosted domestic activity while strong external demand supported Cambodia’s recovery in the first half of 2022, according to the preliminary assessment made by the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO).AMRO prepared the assessment after its annual consultation visit to the Kingdom from July 20 to August 3, 2022.AMRO deputy group head and senior economist Jinho Choi led the team, while its chief economist, Hoe Ee Khor participated in the policy meetings.The discussions focused on the outlook for the post-pandemic recovery, and on sustaining growth while rebuilding fiscal space and maintaining financial stability amid strong headwinds.Talking about the economic prospects and challenges of the country, Dr. Choi said, “The Cambodian economy is projected to grow by five percent in 2022, up from three percent in 2021. In line with Cambodia’s strategy of living with Covid-19, we expect the domestic economy to continue to improve, supported by high vaccination rates and enhanced health protocols.” He also cautioned that the outlook for exports would be\n",
      "challenging.“However, the outlook for exports will be challenging as the US and EU are expected to slow down sharply in the second half of this year, which could weigh heavily on the garment sector,” Dr Choi pointed out.Terming the Cambodian economy as resilient, the report said that the early lifting of Covid-19 restrictions boosted domestic activity while strong external demand supported its recovery in the first half of 2022.“As the economy recovers and Covid-19 becomes endemic, it will be vital to refocus policy toward structural reforms that will help improve the long-term growth potential of the economy,” it said.The report forecasted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation would rise to 5.9 percent in 2022.“CPI inflation spiked in 2022, reflecting soaring global energy and food prices. The rise in food prices is acutely felt by the population as food accounts for 45 percent of the consumption basket. Average inflation for the first half of this year was 6.6 percent, compared to 2.9 percent last year. Upward price pressures on energy and food products are expected to spill over to other goods, exerting broader inflationary pressures, with CPI inflation forecasted to rise to 5.9 percent in 2022,” it noted. The study said the current account deficit widened to an unprecedented level at 45 percent of GDP in 2021, largely due to a surge in gold imports.The imports of consumer and intermediate goods also grew robustly in line with the economic recovery. Nevertheless, the overall balance of payments maintained a slight surplus on account of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, external borrowing, and drawdown in offshore deposits, it said.The study also pointed out some downside risks to the country’s economy.“The uncertainty stemming mainly from the slowdown in key export markets. Headwinds from a slowing global demand amid the Russia-Ukraine war and monetary tightening in the US and Europe could impact Cambodia’s exports of manufacturing products. Given Cambodia’s high concentration of garment exports to the US and Europe, the export sector is vulnerable to demand shocks from these key markets,” it said.The report indicated that a sharper-than-expected slowdown and prolonged tight border controls in China could adversely affect the nation’s growth prospects, given the high reliance on investments and imported intermediate goods from China.It will also affect the revival scope of the tourism sector. “Prolonged border controls in China will also delay the recovery of the tourism industry since prior to the pandemic, more than a third of tourists came from China,” AMRO said.The large current account deficits could be a source of growing external vulnerability, it warned.“Cambodia’s current account deficits prior to the pandemic were well-funded by strong FDI inflows. However, the current account deficit, excluding gold, has markedly widened since 2019. This reflects a number of factors including large imports of construction materials since 2019, the collapse in tourism and lower remittances since 2020, and imports of vaccines and medical supplies and high oil prices since 2021.”However, some of these factors are transitory and the current account is expected to improve significantly in 2022 and 2023.  International reserves of $20 billion also provide a strong buffer, it observed.While announcing its policy recommendations, it said the government should scale back the Covid-19 pandemic support programmes in tandem with the recovery while providing targeted support to vulnerable groups most affected by the high inflation.“The recent rise in food prices is acutely felt by the poor, squeezing their budget for food and other essential items with possible long-term implications on health and productivity. In this regard, efforts by the government to transform the Covid-19 cash transfer into a broad social protection program is highly commendable,” it pointed out.While lauding the efforts of National Bank of Cambodia’s (NBC), it said, “The normalisation of the NBC’s liquidity measures should continue in line with the economic recovery, particularly by gradually raising reserve requirements to pre-pandemic levels. The efforts by the NBC to review and classify restructured loans with the objective of ensuring adequate provisioning are commendable.”The AMRO experts said NBC should continue monitoring the quality of restructured loans, especially for those still under the assessment period. In view of the high level of dollarisation, NBC should continue to maintain exchange rate stability to help mitigate inflationary pressures as well as to maintain investor confidence.It pointed out that the authorities’ efforts to establish a solid regulatory framework to supervise property developers that provide financing should continue.AMRO said the launch of the Non-Bank Financial Services Authority is a welcome move for better control of such shadow banking activities. In this regard, close collaboration across the various government agencies involved in the non-bank sector should be continued, to improve data collection, it noted.“Strong focus on structural reforms should be continued to maintain the growth momentum of the Cambodian economy. Given rising labour costs and the country’s goal to attain high-middle-income status, strong policy commitment, continuity and consistency will help ensure needed reforms are implemented to enhance competitiveness and move up the value chain,” the study said.The promulgation of the new Investment Law and the greater market access through recently agreed bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with China and Korea, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), will provide a strong boost to investments that will help modernise and diversify Cambodia’s economy, it observed.In this regard, well-coordinated policy supports among various ministries are essential for increasing skilled labour supply, developing infrastructure, and improving the institutional environment, the study added.AMRO is an international organisation established to contribute toward securing macroeconomic and financial stability of the Asean+3 region, which includes 10 members of Asean and China; Hong Kong, China; Japan; and Korea. AMRO’s mandate is to conduct macroeconomic surveillance, support the implementation of the regional financial arrangement, the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation, and provide technical assistance to the members, the release said.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501131696/cbc-cgcc-mou-offers-transparent-loan-assessment-for-women-smes/\n",
      "Women and SMEs in Cambodia can expect a more transparent loan assessment following a recent agreement between the Credit Bureau (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. (CBC) and Credit Guarantee Corporation of Cambodia Plc. (CGCC).They signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen financial inclusion for women and SMEs through the promotion of a credit guarantee support scheme and adoption of data analytics in credit decision-making by financial institutions across Cambodia.The cooperation between CBC and CGCC will expand access to credit, by providing more transparent loan assessment to women and SMEs, a statement said.It pointed out that as the only credit reporting service provider in the country, CBC provides credit history information bridging the information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders. Thus, it reduces transaction costs of lending and promotes access to finance.“Over the years, CBC’s credit reporting services and a portfolio of data analytics solutions have eased barriers to credit for many Cambodians and reduced industry-wide credit risk. CBC’s role as key financial infrastructure is significant to maintaining financial sector stability for the country,” the release noted.CGCC provides credit guarantees on loans disbursed by participating financial institutions to support viable businesses and individuals that lack collateral when seeking access to finance. Especially, in the context of the economic slowdown from the pandemic, support from CGCC has been instrumental in driving economic growth, fuelling employment and stabilising the economy.Oeur Sothearoath, Chief Executive Officer of CBC said, “This partnership marks a milestone in enhancing financial inclusion to women and SMEs owners as well as assuring a fair, reliable and data-driven approach in enabling access to finance in the country. This collaboration between CBC and CGCC shall strengthen our financial infrastructure and streamline the much-needed support for SMEs.”Wong Keet Loong, Chief Executive Officer of CGCC, said “With this MoU, CGCC will be able to build the credit profile of guaranteed loans by using CBC’s K-score as a reference for the credit rating of our guaranteed borrowers. When PFIs report the conduct of guaranteed loans in their monthly reporting to CBC, this data would be useful to capture the profile of Cambodian SME borrowers with guaranteed loans. This would further facilitate access to financing for SMEs.”While it is mandatory for every lender to check credit report of borrowers from CBC during loan assessment, CGCC and CBC will collaborate to enable financial institutions to use digitalisation, advanced reporting and data analytics tools from CBC to conduct an accurate risk assessment of borrowers and monitor their performance.Through this collaboration, the two institutions also commit to cooperating in financial education and awareness activities to promote financial inclusion in the country.Since 2012, CBC is the leading provider of financial information, analytical solutions, and credit reporting services to financial institutions and consumers in the Kingdom of Cambodia. CBC assists customers in managing the risks and rewards of commercial and financial decisions through a range of solutions, including Consumer Credit Report, Commercial Credit Report, K-Score, Data Analytical Report, Portfolio Monitoring Service, Portfolio Review Service, and Customized Solutions. CBC serves a member base of 180 financial institutions with credit histories of more than 7 million borrowers.CGCC is a state-owned enterprise operated under the technical and financial guidance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and officially incorporated in November 2020. CGCC’s mission is to provide credit guarantees to lenders on loans made to businesses based on international standards to share the risk with lenders and to improve financial inclusion. As of the end of July, CGCC has supported 591 businesses by providing credit guarantees for their loan applications, amounting to $57.4 million equivalent. CGCC has provided the most guarantee to SMEs, which is accounted for 96 percent of the total businesses receiving the credit guarantee from CGCC.\n",

      "As part of its plan to further digitalization, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) on Tuesday handed over information technology (IT) materials to 36 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the country to use in doing digital business with online market Cambodia Trade Market under the e-commerce project Go4eCAM, said a release.The IT materials handed over during a ceremony was attended by the secretary of state of MoC Tekreth Kamrang to 21 firms led by women entrepreneurs and 19 that are in operation in provinces so that they can improve their businesses in the context of Industry 4.0 through e-commerce.Penn Sovicheat, Ministry of Commerce’s spokesman told Khmer Times that the Go4eCAM project that operates Cambodia Trade website www.cambodiatrade.com, was officially launched in late March as an online marketplace for Cambodia-made products to go online.“In the implementation of the project, we also have entrepreneurship support in technology and materials. We have assessed and found some small and medium enterprises that are potentially relatively to our marketplace, but then they need the necessary materials or equipment to participate in the platform. Without computers they will not be able to sell their products online,” Sovicheat said.Sovicheat, who is also an undersecretary of the state of MoC, went on to add that the ministry provided a few sets of desktop computers to 36 SMEs as tools to go to e-commerce. “Hopefully, when they grow, they will be able to afford the equipment themselves,” he said.“Meeting owners of small and medium enterprises in person is important to understand their needs in participating in the trading platform. Currently, they are gradually getting orders from local and overseas – US, Netherland, Australia, Japan and Switzerland – customers,” Kamrang said. Kamrang urged commerce officials to support and train SME owners who are in need of doing e-commerce businesses before handing over those IT materials to those 36 owners of SMEs and encouraged them to actively do business on the platform.Ho Chomnab, owner of social enterprise Fair Weave in Phnom Penh, told Khmer Times that he has set up a set of a brand new desktop computer including a CPU, a monitor, keyboard, mouse, mouse pad and UPS he has just received from MoC for his existing staff who till then used a personal laptop to work at his business premise. “I believe it will help us work faster and more effectively, especially in administrative, accounting, financial and online sale functions,” he said, adding that his company was established in early 2022 with women silk yarn weavers in Banteay Meanchey province.The SMEs have displayed various types of products such as silk, hand-made toys, sauces, hygiene coals and wooden sculptures on the Cambodia Trade Market at the website where they are expected to receive orders, electronic cash payment and delivery to both local and overseas buyers in the forms of B2B and B2C.Also, 135 non-SME firms have been listed and 1,200 products were displayed for sale on the website. “It will help promote those products more broadly in domestic as well as overseas markets to boost their sales,” the release added.\n",

      "Credit Bureau (Cambodia) and Credit Guarantee Corporation (CGCC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen financial inclusion for women and SMEs through the promotion of credit guarantee support scheme and adoption of data analytics in credit decision-making by financial institutions across Cambodia.The cooperation between CBC and CGCC will expand access to credit, by providing more transparent loan assessment to women and SMEs.As the only credit reporting service provider in the country, CBC provides credit history information bridging the information asymmetry between borrower and lenders, thus, reducing transaction costs of lending and promoting access to finance.Over the years, CBC’s credit reporting services and a portfolio of data analytics solutions have eased barriers to credit for many Cambodians and reduced industry-wide credit risk. CBC’s role as a key financial infrastructure is significant to maintaining financial sector stability for the country.CGCC provides credit guarantees on loans disbursed by participating financial institutions to support viable businesses and individuals that lack collateral when seeking access to finance.Especially, in the context of the economic slowdown from the pandemic, support from CGCC has been instrumental in driving economic growth, fuelling employment and stabilizing the economy.Oeur Sothearoath, Chief Executive Officer of CBC said, “This partnership marks a milestone in enhancing financial inclusion to women and SMEs owners as well as assuring a fair, reliable and data-driven approach in enabling access to finance for in the country. This collaboration between CBC and CGCC shall strengthen our financial infrastructure and streamline the much needed support for SMEs.”Wong Keet Loong, Chief Executive Officer of CGCC said “With this MOU, CGCC will be able to build the credit profile of guaranteed loans by using CBC’s K-score as a reference for credit rating of our guaranteed borrowers.“When PFIs report the conduct of guaranteed loans in their monthly reporting to CBC, this data would be useful to capture the profile of Cambodian SME borrowers with guaranteed loans. This would further facilitate access to financing for SMEs.”While it is mandatory for every lender to check credit report of borrowers from CBC during loan assessment, CGCC and CBC will collaborate to enable financial institution to use digitalisation, advanced reporting and data analytics tools from CBC to conduct accurate risk assessment of borrowers and monitor their performance.Through this collaboration, the two institutions also commit to cooperate in financial education and awareness activities to promote financial inclusion in the country.\n",

      "The number of young people globally who can’t find a job this year is set to reach 73 million – that’s a full six million more than before Covid-19 – the UN labour agency said on Thursday.According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the pandemic has caused many additional problems for 15 to 24-year-olds who’ve experienced “much higher” unemployment losses than older workers since the global health emergency was declared in early 2020.Young women have struggled more than their male counterparts to find work, while Arab nations are expected to see the highest levels of youth unemployment by the end of the year, compared to the global average.“We know that the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on youth labour markets around the world,” said Martha Newton, ILO Deputy Director-General for Policy. “It’s exposed a number of shortcomings in the way the needs of young people are addressed, especially the most vulnerable first-time job seekers, school dropouts, fresh graduates with little experience and those who remain inactive not by choice.”Speaking at the launch of ILO’s report, Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022: Investing in transforming futures for young people, Ms Newton said that the share of youth not in employment, education or training in 2020 rose to 23.3 per cent.That represents an increase of 1.5 percentage points from 2019 and represents a level not seen in at least 15 years, the ILO report found.“This group of young people are at particular risk of seeing their labour market opportunities and outcomes deteriorate also over the longer-term as ‘scarring’ effects take hold,” the report noted.Gender inequalityThe report’s takeaways include the worrying finding that young women are worse off than young men when it comes to finding a job. This year, fewer than three in 10 young women globally are expected to be in work, compared to well over four in 10 young men.“The gender gap, which has shown little sign of closing over the past two decades, is largest in lower-middle-income countries, at 17.3 percentage points, and smallest in high-income countries, at 2.3 percentage points,” the ILO report stated.Only high-income countries on course to recoverLatest labour data scrutinised by ILO also indicated that only high-income counties are likely to see a recovery in youth unemployment levels “close to those of 2019” by the end of this year.In lower-income countries, youth unemployment rates are projected to remain more than one percentage point above pre-crisis values.In Africa, the continent’s youth unemployment rate of 12.7 per cent masks the fact that many youths have chosen to withdraw from the labour market altogether, ILO said. It noted that “over one in five young people in Africa was not in employment, education, or training in 2020, and the trend has been deteriorating”.The Arab States have the highest and the fastest growing unemployment rate of young people worldwide, projected at 24.8 per cent in 2022. “The situation is worse for young women in the region, with 42.5 per cent unemployment in 2022, which is almost three times as high as the global average for young women (14.5 per cent),” ILO said.In Europe and Central Asia, unemployment among 15 to 24-year-olds is expected to be 1.5 per cent higher than the rest of the world this year (16.4 per cent compared with 14.9 per cent). Although there has been “substantial progress” in reducing youth unemployment for both women and men, ILO said that the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “highly likely to affect the results”.While the Asia Pacific region is set to see 14.9 per cent of young workers still looking for a job by the end of the year, in line with the global average, the picture will likely remain worrying in Latin America, where the rate is expected to be 20.5 per cent.“Historically, young women’s unemployment rates have been higher than young men’s (in Latin American countries), but the crisis exacerbated this trend,” ILO’s report stated.The picture is radically different in North America, however, where the youth and young adult unemployment rate is expected to be well world average levels, at 8.3 per cent.Solutions are green and blueTo address the problem, the UN labour agency urged governments to implement sustainable green and blue (ocean) policy measures. According to the report, this could generate an additional 8.4 million jobs for young people by 2030.Targeted investments in digital technologies could also absorb high numbers of young workers, ILO maintained. By achieving universal broadband coverage by 2030, some 24 million new jobs could be created worldwide it said, with young workers taking 6.4 million of them. UN News \n",

      "Strong fiscal stimulus and high vaccination rates have helped quickened Cambodia’s economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, an ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report said on Thursday.In its Cambodia Economic Outlook 2022, the AMRO said the Cambodian economy has been resilient, adding that the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions boosted domestic activity while strong external demand supported the economic recovery in the first half of 2022.“The Cambodian economy is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2022, up from 3 percent in 2021,” AMRO deputy group head and senior economist Jinho Choi said in a news release.“We expect the domestic economy to continue to improve, supported by high vaccination rates and enhanced health protocols,” he said.“However, the outlook for exports will be challenging as the United States and the European Union are expected to slow down sharply in the second half of this year, which could weigh heavily on the garment sector,” Choi added.The report said Cambodia’s new investment law, and the greater market access through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) will provide a strong boost to investments that will help modernize and diversify the kingdom’s economy.It also highlighted some downside risks to Cambodia’s growth, including a slowing global demand amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and monetary tightening in the United States and Europe.According to the report, Cambodia’s inflation was forecast to rise to 5.9 percent in 2022, up from 2.9 percent last year, fuelled by soaring global energy and food prices.Cambodia has so far administered COVID-19 vaccines to 15.14 million people, or 94.6 percent of its 16 million population, and China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines have been widely used in the kingdom’s immunization programs.Cambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesperson Penn Sovicheat said high vaccination rates, the RCEP, and the CCFTA are the key factors of boosting the country’s post-pandemic economic growth.“Under the RCEP and the CCFTA, which both took effect earlier this year, we are confident that Cambodia’s exports to China and other RCEP participating countries will be bigger, especially the exports of potential agricultural products such as rice, bananas and mangoes, industrial products, and processing goods,” he told Xinhua.The RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Ky Sereyvath, a senior economist and director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, agreed that fiscal stimulus, high vaccination rates and free tree agreements are the boosters for Cambodia’s economic growth.“Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have not only protected millions of Cambodian people’s lives and stabilized the health system, but also helped boost Cambodia’s economic recovery,” he told Xinhua.\n",

      "Cambodia’s manufacturing output hit $7.57 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of 2022, a remarkable increase of 75 percent year on year, an industry ministry spokesperson said here on Thursday.Heng Sokkung, secretary of state and spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, said that during the Jan.-June period of this year, products worth $5.26 billion were exported while $2.31-billion worth of products were sold on the domestic market.Sokkung attributed the situation to a rise in both the domestic and international market demands after the COVID-19 pandemic waned worldwide.“The manufacturing sector is estimated to contribute 39.9 percent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022,” he said during a press conference, adding that the sector has created some 1.04 million jobs in the country.Of the 1,947 manufacturing plants in total in the Southeast Asian country, some 1,100 are garment, footwear and travel goods factories, and the rest are food and beverage, automotive assembly, cement, electronics, and pharmaceutical factories, among others, he added.

      "Some 112 new factories, with a total investment of $1.19 billion, had opened in Cambodia during the first seven months of 2022, an industry ministry spokesperson said here on Thursday.“These new factories have created jobs for 76,624 people,” Heng Sokkung, a secretary of state and spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation, said during a press conference, adding that most of the new factories produce garment, footwear and travel goods.The cited period also saw the closure of 47 factories, leaving 16,838 workers unemployed, according to him.Lim Heng, vice president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) as well as the country’s favorable new investment law are key to attracting new investors.“Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, many new factories have been established in Cambodia. This clearly shows that the Southeast Asian nation is a potential destination for both domestic and foreign investors, especially for the Chinese ones,” he told Xinhua.“New investment has not only brought in new capital, but also advanced technologies as well as new jobs for Cambodians,” he added.

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130562/21-rise-in-cambodias-trade-us-the-biggest-export-market/\n",
      "Cambodia’s international trade rose to $32.82 billion in the first seven months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 21.3 percent, and the United States is the biggest market for the country accounting for 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports.From January to July, Cambodia exported $13.78 billion worth of goods to foreign markets, up 30.7 percent compared to the same period last year, showed the latest report of the General Department of Customs and Excise.The Kingdom’s total imports rose by 15.4 percent during the same period to $19.05 billion.The US remains the biggest market for Cambodian products, with 43 percent of the Kingdom’s total exports or $5.69 billion, a 47.3 percent year-on-year increase, the report underlined. The spike in exports to the US is remarkable considering the still pending renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Vietnam and China were ranked second and third, importing $1.32 billion and $701 million worth of products from Cambodia, respectively, it added. Meanwhile, China remained the largest trading partner of Cambodia, followed by the US, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore, the report said.Trade volume between Cambodia and China was valued at $6.97 billion in the first seven months of 2022, up 15.6 percent year-on-year.The report noted that trade with China accounted for 21 percent of Cambodia’s total trade volume of 32.8 billion dollars during the January-July period.The resumption of socio-economic activities, trade pacts such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and bilateral free trade agreement with China have been cited as reasons for the spurt in production and trade. The significant growth in production and trade is also due to Cambodia’s high vaccination rates.Garment, footwear and travel goods shared almost 50 percent of the total commodity exports, followed by non-garment products and agricultural products.Dr Ky Sereyvath, Director of the Institute of China Studies and economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Khmer Times that the early reopening of the economy had helped the revival of the production chain leading to the spike in exports.“The trend indicates that the total trade will return to the pre-Covid-19 level soon,” Dr Sereyvath said. “But orders for the garment sector have seen a drop due to the European crisis (following the Russia-Ukraine war),” he noted.“Cambodia still has a number of preferential trade systems, such as the Everything But Arms (EBA) of European Union. But, exports can still go down later this year due to the crisis in Europe and global inflation,” Dr Sereyvath said.There was also relocation of factories from neighbouring countries to Cambodia to take advantage of the early reopening of the economy and this has also contributed to the spike in production and exports.\n",

      "Senior government officials and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Wednesday discussed ways to assess the vulnerability of Cambodia when the country leaves the Least Developed Country status, according to a release by the Ministry of Commerce (MoC).The three-day discussion was held at MoC on Wednesday and was led by Bun Chanthy, undersecretary of state of MoC and Junior Davis, director of research and analysis of UNCTAD who presented Cambodia’s stages of leaving LDC status.Cambodia will need to conduct a study on four aspects of its vulnerability that include firstly an analysis of the general situation of its production capacity compared to other countries in the region, second determination of vulnerability based on prosperity, peace, human, environment and partnership, thirdly impacts of vulnerability and lastly policies of economic and environmental resilience.“The study will be conducted by collecting information and data from ministries and institutions in Cambodia for analysis to prepare recommendations for the government so that it will be able to prepare strategies of leaving the status smoothly,” the release said.Junior said that the Kingdom will be reviewed for the second time in 2024 to determine whether or not it can leave LDC after it passed a grade of leaving LDC status first time was in 2021 with the assessment of Gross National Product (GNP), Human Development Index (HDI) and economic and environmental vulnerability.“When leaving LDC status, Cambodia would lose generalised system of preferences, technical frameworks and concessional loans and so on,” Junior said. UNCTAD team will meet government officials in person to discuss further the preparation of the study plan and any concerns regarding leaving the LDC status of Cambodia.On his part Chanthy said Cambodia needs to prepare national strategies for LDC status smoothly without severely being impacted by losing GSP and measures in relation to international aid, especially during a transition period, adding that the government has made efforts to restore and rebuild the country for over three decades after the civil war to achieve and maintain full peace and quicken socio-economic development.During an annual meeting of MoC, Aun Pornmoniroth, Minister of Economy and Finance, said that the ministry needs to pay attention to cooperating with international organisations that are professionally independent and other ministries and institutions to conduct studies on the date and possibility of Cambodia’s leaving LDC status with strength and resilience against external shocks.“Especially, the ministry needs to be well prepared for negotiation to request for GSP Plus to maintain markets, production level and attraction of investment in the country. The ministry also needs to study the impacts of preferences eroded through competition with some other countries that have established bilateral free trade agreements with trade partners of Cambodia,” Pornmoniroth added.Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed optimism recently that Cambodia will definitely achieve its vision of a high-middle-income country by 2030 and attributed it to the country’s peace and economic growth, particularly the socio-economic resumption after the pandemic, adding that in the light of peace, the Cambodian people have achieved great and proud changes, especially in the economic and social fields.“Realising high and sustainable economic growth over the past two decades has moved Cambodia from a low-income country to a low-middle-income country and is striving to achieve its vision of a high-middle-income country in 2030,” the premier said.\n",

      "The trade volume between Cambodia and China surged 15.6 percent year-on-year to $6.97 billion in the first seven months of this year, a General Department of Customs and Excise report said.China accounted for 21 percent of the Kingdom’s total trade volume of $32.8 billion during the January-July period in 2022.The surge in trade volume helped China retain its position as the largest trading partner of Cambodia.The other top trading partners of the Kingdom were the United States, followed by Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore during the period.Cambodia’s main exports to China included milled rice, bananas, mangos, cassava, fishery and apparel.The Kingdom also imported garment raw materials, machinery, vehicles, foodstuffs, electronics, medicines, etc from China during the period.While talking about the increase in imports, Penn Sovicheat, Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman, told Khmer Times that the trade cooperation between Cambodia and China has been rising despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“China is a huge market for Cambodia, and despite the pandemic, our bilateral trade volume has steadily increased,” Sovicheat said.“The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which came into force this year, played a big role in improving trade relations.“The pacts have been enhancing the trade relations between both countries,” he said.He expressed confidence that the bilateral trade and investment volumes between both nations would continue to grow in the coming years due to the positive impact of the two trade agreements.Sovicheat is also optimistic about a further improvement in trade ties with China as the Kingdom was keen to export more agricultural products to Beijing in the coming years.He also hailed the roles of CCFTA and RCEP for enhancing the country’s agricultural and fruit exports to China.RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 Asean member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Recently, Prime Minister Hun Sen also pointed out the significance of RCEP while speaking at the Asean Day. The Prime Minister said RCEP would be a booster for regional and global economic recovery in the post-Covid era.Mr Hun Sen said the full and effective implementation of the RCEP agreement is a priority.RCEP will stimulate economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, create jobs, and strengthen the supply chain in the region and the world as a whole, he said.“As the chair of Asean 2022, Cambodia will work closely with RCEP countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the agreement to intensify the facilitation of cross-border trade movements further,” the Premier said.According to an Asian Development Bank’s study, the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 per cent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment.Meanwhile, Ky Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said that RCEP and CCFTA have significantly boosted the trade volume between the two Asian nations.“Through RCEP and the CCFTA, I think Cambodia can be a hub-and-spoke model to distribute goods from China to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region in the future,” he told Xinhua.Last month a report from the Council for the Development of Cambodia said the Kingdom attracted fixed-asset investment of $1.29 billion from China in the first half of 2022.China remained the top foreign investor in Cambodia, accounting for 43 percent of the total investment of $2.99 billion the country approved during the first six months of this year, CDC said.The sectors that attracted investment during the period were agriculture and agro-industry, manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure. \n",

      "Cambodia exported $13.78 billion worth of goods in the January-July period of this year, up by 30.7 percent compared to the same period last year, the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) report said on Wednesday.The total value of the Kingdom’s international trade rose by 21.3 percent to $32.82 billion, the report said, citing that imports increased by 15.4 percent to $19.05 billion during the period.The US remains the biggest market for Cambodia’s products, stated the report, citing that export amounted to $5.69 billion, a year-on-year increase of 47.3 percent, accounting for 45.2 percent of the total export.Vietnam is the second largest market with exports at $1.32 billion, followed by China at $701 million.Broken down by sector, garment, footwear and travel goods share almost 50 percent of the total commodity exports, followed by non-garment industry products and agricultural products, the report said.Cambodia’s exports have significantly increased due to the successful and efficient Covid-19 management by the government, leading to the resumption of all kinds of economic activities, said Lim Heng, vice president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.“The government has controlled the Covid-19 situation, reopened borders to tourists, resumed socio-economic activities – leading to keeping the production chains in factories,” Heng said.Trade preferences, the regional free trade agreement – RCEP and Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement are factors opening up wider markets for Cambodia-made products and attracting new investment, he said.The government has launched the strategic framework and program for economic recovery and to promote Cambodia’s economic growth for 2021-2023.Penn Sovicheat, undersecretary of state and spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, attributed the growth to the Cambodia-made products’ quality that has won the confidence of buyers and consumers.“Cambodia is a country with a reputation as a source of large supply with the trust of consumers and buyers. In fact, in the context of the outbreak of Covid-19, Cambodia’s exports continue to grow as some countries fail to supply their markets,” he said in a recent press conference.\n",

      "The Regional Cooperation Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Free Trade Agreement with China have increased manufacturing factories in Cambodia.Cambodia has a total of 1,947 factories with a registered investment value of $15.7 billion as of June this year, the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation’s report said on Thursday.The manufacturing factories produced products worth $7.57 billion in the first half of 2022, a significant rise of 75 percent year-on-year, stated the report, citing that the products worth $5.26 billion were exported and the rest were sold domestically.From January to July of this year, 112 new factories opened while 47 factories closed down.FTA with China, RCEP, and strong demand for Cambodia-made products in the US and Europe, which are Cambodia’s main markets, have built confidence in investors to  invest in Cambodia, Secretary of State and spokesman Heng Sokkung said.“Purchase orders in the US and EU and new markets under the RCEP and with FTA with China and Korea are potential in attracting new investment to the country,” Sokkung told Khmer Times on Thursday.Securing sufficient raw materials to local production chains is another factor in building bold confidence in investors, he said, citing that those raw materials are imported mainly from China.The manufacturing sector is estimated to contribute 39.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022, he said, adding that the sector has created some 1.04 million jobs.Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, attributed the growth in the manufacturing sector to peace, effective pandemic crisis management, regional trade pacts and FTA with China.“The free trade agreement with China and soon with Korea and the RCEP attracted new investors to inject investment in Cambodia while Cambodia controlled Covid-19,” Heng said on Thursday.Increasing global demand is also giving a big boost to the growth of the sector, he said.Among the manufacturing plants in Cambodia, 1,100 are garment, footwear and travel goods factories, and the rest are food and beverage, automotive assembly, cement, electronics, and pharmaceutical factories, among others.The garment, footwear and travel goods industry is the largest foreign exchange earner for Cambodia.However, the non-garment manufacturing products are significantly increasing in value export.Sokkung said the government was diversifying from garment production to non-garment sectors.“We are now boosting investment in the non-garment and textile sector due to its value-addition, pushing technology-based production chains to increase quality and quantity to meet demand,” Sokhung said.New non-garment manufacturing factories that have started operations lately are vehicle tire producing plants and vehicle assembly plants.The non-garment industry product export was $1,520 million in the January-July period of this year, which is a 58 percent increase compared to the same period last year. \n",

      "AFP – Singapore on Thursday narrowed its economic growth forecast this year after the economy contracted in the second quarter compared to the previous three months due to rising inflation and tighter monetary policies, the government said.Moves by central banks worldwide to tighten borrowing costs in order to deal with rocketing prices have weighed down on global demand for Singapore’s exports, with the government painting a grim picture.Economists often see the performance of the city state’s open, trade-driven economy as a barometer for global trading activity.Singapore’s economy is now projected to expand by 3.0 to 4.0 percent this year, trimmed from a 3.0 to 5.0 forecast earlier, the trade ministry said. The economy grew by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter to June, faster than the 3.8 per cent growth recorded. But compared to the previous three months, the economy contracted by 0.2 per cent, reversing the 0.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.“Stronger than expected inflationary pressures and the more aggressive tightening of monetary policy in response are expected to weigh on growth in major advanced economies such as the US and Eurozone.”China, a key market for global exports, “continues to grapple with a deepening property market downturn and recurring domestic Covid-19 outbreaks”, it said.Growth in the United States is expected to slow further in the second half of the year, and “the persistent disruption in natural gas supplies from Russia could also trigger a sharp slowdown in the Eurozone economy”, it warned.Selena Ling, chief economist at OCBC Bank, said the strong recovery in the aviation and tourism sectors after Singapore lifted coronavirus restrictions should help cushion the effects of slowing global demand.\n",

      "Xinhua – South Korea’s employment kept rising for 17 straight months last month due to export growth that led to higher jobs in the manufacturing industry, statistical office data showed Wednesday.The number of those employed totalled 28,475,000 in July, up 826,000 from the same month last year, according to Statistics Korea.Jobs continued to grow for 17 months since March last year, but the year-on-year employment growth slowed after peaking at 1,135,000 in January and 1,037,000 in February.  Driven by export increase, the number of jobs among manufacturers grew 176,000 in July from a year ago, marking the highest since November 2015.Employment in the health and social welfare sector expanded by 130,000 last month, and the reading in the information and communications segment climbed by 95,000.  The number of jobs lost in the finance and insurance and the wholesale and retail segments came in at 21,000 and 10,000 respectively.The overall job growth was led by the elderly people. The number of jobs among those aged 60 or higher jumped 479,000 in July from a year earlier, and those in their 50s and 20s climbed 194,000 and 95,000 each.The number of regular employees increased by 895,000, but the readings for irregular workers and daily labourers were down 52,000 and 77,000 each last month. The number of the self-employed who hired workers picked up 78,000, and the figure for the self-employed without employees added 49,000.The employment rate for those aged 15 or higher rose 1.6 percentage points from a year earlier to 62.9 percent in July, posting the highest July figure since relevant data began to be compiled in 1982. The OECD-method hiring rate for those aged 15-64 went up 2.0 percentage points to 69.1 percent.The number of those unemployed stood at 836,000 in July, down 84,000 from a year earlier.

      "Delcom Kampuchea, a joint venture between Cambodian and Chinese investors, started its trial operation in Preah Vihear province on August 4. So far the new firm has extracted around 20 kgs of gold oreBoosting the prospects of gold production, one more gold mining firm recently started its trial operations in the country.Delcom Kampuchea, a joint venture between Cambodian and Chinese investors, started its trial operation in Preah Vihear province on August 4.The new firm has extracted around 20 kilogrammes of gold ore, said Ung Dipola, Director General of Mineral Resources at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, at a press conference recently.Delcom Kampuchea, a medium-sized company, is scheduled to produce around 340 kilogrammes of gold annually.The government is expected to receive an annual royalty income of $600,000 from Delcom Kampuchea, which received a gold exploration license in 2009.On the other hand, Renaissance Minerals (Cambodia) Ltd., a unit of Australia-listed Emerald Resources NL and the first commercial gold extraction company in Cambodia produced 3.5 tonnes of gold ore with 90 percent pure gold solution.Located in Mondulkiri province, Renaissance Minerals, after more than 14 years of exploration, started mining operations in July last year.The government also received $5.1 million in royalties from the company, which refined about 3,543 kilograms, equivalent to 232 gold bars.Cambodia, which expects to produce three tonnes of gold annually for the first eight years, looks to increase production later.When the Renaissance Minerals started extracting ore from the Okvau Gold Deposit in Mondulkiri province, Prime Minister Hun Sen said that Renaissance expects to generate gross revenues of $185 million annually within eight years of extraction.The government is expected to earn more than $40 million from tax and royalties.“This start is clearly showing that our efforts in the mining industry were indeed viable, and we can extract the underground resources to serve our social and economic development with high responsibility,” Mr Hun Sen said.As of 2021, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued gold mining licenses to seven companies in five provinces.The gold mining sites in the country are located in the provinces of Kratie, Preah Vihear, Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri and Battambang.\n",

      "Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Australia’s ambassador to Cambodia held talks on agricultural cooperation between the two countries.Minister Veng Sakhon requested the Australian side to review and support cooperation with private companies – both domestic and foreign – to establish a rice seed production facility to distribute to farmers across the country.The seed has been already developed by the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute.He also proposed the establishment of internship programs for agricultural students and strengthening other technical cooperation, including the processing of agricultural products in the new project, which will be implemented at the end of 2022.As a result of the Cambodia-Australia Agricultural Value Chain program (CAVAC), he confirmed that the project has made a significant contribution to the construction and development of the Cambodian agricultural value chain.Pablo Kang, the Australian ambassador, said that his country supports Cambodia in socio-economic development through technical and financial assistance in a number of key areas, especially agriculture, infrastructure, education and energy.He also underlined the long-standing cooperation between the two sides and reaffirmed Australia’s cooperation.According to a report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, there is mutual cooperation between the two countries in the development of the agricultural sector through AusAid.It also detailed the development and release of good crop varieties for farmers, development and transfer of agricultural techniques, the use of nutrients for innovation, sustainability and economic profitability, training human resources in agricultural talent and collaboration on research and development.According to a report from the Australian Embassy released in 2010, Australia has invested AUD 130 million through CAVAC to improve rice productivity, irrigation for smallholder farmers, and agriculture diversification in Cambodia.The program has reduced rural poverty, substantially increased farmer incomes and supported Cambodia’s agriculture sector to become more commercially viable and competitive, the report said.CAVAC will officially end on August 15 2022, but the successor program – the AUD 87 million Cambodia-Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAP-RED) – will continue supporting Cambodia’s economic recovery.The Government of Australia has pledged to provide grant aid to Cambodia under the Cambodia-Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAP-RED) programme for eight years, from 2022-2030.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130766/more-and-more-young-entrepreneurs-attend-buddhas-dharma-business-workshop/\n",
      "More and more Cambodians – specially the young – recently attended a workshop on Buddha’s dharma strategies to build business partnership organised by local media firm Lotus Broadcasting Service Co Ltd (Lotus) in Chba Ampov district of Phnom Penh.The workshop at Romdoul Village Resort in Prek Thmey quarter had presentations by a prominent Cambodian economist and other well-known Cambodian entrepreneurs to about 50 participants, mostly young entrepreneurs and professionals.Mey Kalyan, senior advisor of the Supreme National Economic Council (SNEC), told Khmer Times on the sidelines of the workshop that he has noticed more and more people, especially young entrepreneurs and professionals coming to attend the workshop, which is a remarkable trend.“Today, I have seen that there are more people coming, especially the younger generation. It is very good that they are interested more and more and I want to see this continuing,” Kalyan said. Participants are mostly owners of businesses in agriculture machinery, real estate, money exchange, rice sale, silk, pharmacy and publishing.Ieng Sotheara, a prominent Cambodian businessman who practised Buddha dharma in his businesses in real estate development, hospitality and media, was one of the speakers at the workshop. Sotheara is also the president of Cambodia-Japan Association for Business and Investment (CJBI).Sotheara said Buddha’s dharma teaches both entrepreneurs and people to practice indication of business partnership through good friendship, which consists of four main indicators for them to examine before entering to any partnership agreements and they include faith or generosity, noble precept, contribution and intelligence.Entrepreneurs should also assess the current status of their business partnership they are being in through looking into models that include one plus one equal minus, one plus one equal zero, one plus one equal two or one plus one equal greater than two and then compare them with the Buddha’s dharma principle of business partnership, he explained.“You have to examine action, speech and heart of any person who you want to partner with in business, which means whether they do what they say and whether they have intelligence, not just looking at potentials of the company such as much money or good information. They should think beforehand about a way of exit in case of any problem within the partnership,” Sotheara explained.“In terms of noble precept, you need to figure out whether that person knows good deed and bad deed. For example, your concept is that you do not want to do business that is against laws, social morality or contribution, but that person does not care about these things, but focusing only on earning money and taking advantage on agreement,” he added.Sotheara added that the young generations should understand that Buddha’s dharma not only teach people to be prepared for next life, but also to live current life better such as how to use the techniques to become wealthy, healthy and happy in family. “That’s why we all need to explain them to understand these principles or concepts better,” Sothear responded to a question raised by a young man. \n",

      "Markets track Wall St rally as soft US inflation boosts rate hopes\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501130769/markets-track-wall-st-rally-as-soft-us-inflation-boosts-rate-hopes/\n",
      "AFP – Asian markets rallied Thursday as investors breathed a sigh of relief after data showed US inflation finally easing from a four-decade high, giving the Federal Reserve some room to slow down its pace of interest rate hikes.The below-forecast reading on consumer prices came on the back of a sharp drop in energy costs and provided a much-needed boost to risk assets across the board.Wall Street enjoyed a surge that saw the Nasdaq pile on more than two percent and push it into a technical bull market – having spiked more than 20 percent from its June lows – while the dollar dropped against its peers.And Treasury yields – a gauge of future interest rates – dropped.Trading floors had been nervous going into Wednesday’s release, as many had feared a forecast-topping figure would beef up pressure on the Fed to announce another bumper rate hike at its September meeting.Fears that the bank’s monetary tightening drive would send the world’s top economy into recession have dragged markets lower for months, with the mood already darkened by several issues including the Ukraine war, supply chain snarls and worsening China-US relations.The positive energy from New York filtered through to Asia, where Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei and Manila all rose more than one percent, while Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta were also well up.But while sentiment was positive, analysts warned against getting over-excited as inflation was still high and would take some time to get under control.“We still need to see a couple more monthly decreases in underlying inflation before the (Fed) can start to think about pausing its tightening cycle,” Carol Kong, of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg Television.“The market is still currently underestimating US inflation and how sticky it will be over the medium term.”Meanwhile, Fed officials were out trying to temper expectations that they might start reducing borrowing costs as soon as next year.Minneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari warned “we are a long way away from saying that we’re anywhere close to declaring victory”, while Chicago bank boss Charles Evans added rates would continue to rise for “the rest of this year and into next year”.Investors will be hanging on further comments from policymakers over the next weeks for an idea about the pace of rate hikes, with a still-strong jobs growth showing the economy remained resilient despite higher borrowing costs and inflation.“Inflation has been expected to peak over the summer for some time, so it was reassuring for markets that there are clear signs that this looks to be happening,” said Oliver Blackbourn, of Janus Henderson Investors.“However, the Fed will doubtless be focused on the signs about underlying inflation, particularly against a very tight-looking labour market.”And Christian Hoffmann, at Thornburg Investment Management, added: “We should not be surprised to see Fed speakers continue to try to talk down the market and risk assets.”Oil prices edged down as demand expectations continued to be sapped by worries about a recession, with both main contracts around six-month lows and below their pre-Ukraine war levels.The selling was also being fed by data showing US stockpiles at their highest levels since December thanks to a pick-up in domestic output, while some flows to three European countries from Russia resumed after a payment dispute linked to sanctions was resolved.\n",

      "The Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC) on Wednesday expressed concern over a decline in purchase orders from Western countries for the second half of 2022.GMAC Secretary-General Ken Loo said the unstable global situation and the likeliness of an economic downturn mainly in Western countries have raised “serious concern over the export situation for the second half of the year.”“Many members have informed the GMAC of the reduced /revised order situation and some have sought legal advice from GMAC legal team on the procedure for a possible partial production suspension,” he said in a news release.“The GMAC is conducting an extensive survey among all members to analyze the order situation more accurately,” he added.Amid this serious concern, Cambodia is going through a huge jump in labor-related costs after the government announced the implementation of pension fund contribution and annual minimum wage revision to take effect in January, he said.“This double cost increase is serious enough to be worried, not to mention other issues like higher logistics cost and higher cost of compliance which is increasing every year due to buyers’ demand,” Loo said.Looking forward, he suggested that Cambodia need to be proactive and cautious about things that would put more cost pressure on the companies.The garment, footwear and travel goods industry is the largest foreign exchange earner for Cambodia. The sector consists of roughly 1,100 factories and branches, employing approximately 750,000 workers, mostly female.According to the General Department of Customs and Excise, the Southeast Asian nation exported products totally worth $6.6 billion during the first half of this year, up 40 percent from $4.72 billion over the same period last year.

      "The percentage of petroleum station owners complying with the legal requirements to run their oil and gas stations has soared to 73 percent early this month, according to a senior official at the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). The increase followed after the petroleum law was enacted in 2018.The law on the management of petroleum and petroleum products was adopted by Cambodia’s National Assembly in mid-July 2019 to regulate the downstream activities of the country’s petroleum sector requires that owners of petroleum and gas stations set up standardized technical and safety management on the premises.Nearly 570 or 15 percent of 3,778 owners of oil and gas stations submitted applications for certificates and permits to MME in 2018 and over 3,400 or 67 percent of\n",
      "over 5,000 in 2021, according to a five-year achievement report of the government.MME has issued 63 licenses and 17 permits for commercial operations for oil and gas that include inventory centres, importing, transportation, supplying, distributing and packaging for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021, according to the report, adding that the ministry has provided 344 certificates of technical fulfilment and 1,931 permits for operations for oil and gas stations during the period.Cheap Sour, director general of general department of petroleum of MME, said during a press conference that mostly franchised petroleum and gas stations have been facing technical and safety standard issues, while stations run by companies such as Kampuchea Tela, Sokimex Investment Group, Chevron (Cambodia) Limited, TotalEnergies, etc. follow the law and regulations well.“After we have conducted raising awareness, education and training, we have seen more and more people understand the requirements and so they have come to apply for license to improve their technical and safety standards in running their stations,” said Sour, who did not mention the number of licenses, permits and certificates.Sour, who is also the spokesman of the ministry, added that owners of petroleum and gas stations in Cambodia need to follow standards and requirements set by the law and regulations by improving their assembly equipment such as pump topper, petrol tanks and turbine pumps.Preap Deta, general manager at PRN4 Tela Gas Station along National Road 4 in Ang Snuol district of Kandal province, told Khmer Times that the owners of the stations have fulfilled all requirements set by the MME and he was assigned to attend training on standards and safety at the provincial hall and officials have visited the station.However, Deta said that the current economic condition has been unfavourable for oil and gas stations to implement the requirements, especially improvement as the price of oil has not been stable and the companies sometimes did not have sufficient products to supply to the stations, while the government set prices for sale that do not enable us to gain profit.“Logically, we do business to make profit, but the economic situation is like this, mostly we cannot make it, but loss, especially those who rent premises and hire staff. That’s why I think to improve the stations as per legal requirements is most likely impossible because we need money to spend on improvement,” said Deta.He went on the add that some of the oil and gas station owners he knows have suspended operations and some are in plan as they have received losses every month, while customers have reduced consumption remarkably such as drivers of cars, tuk-tuks and motorbikes as they have generated less and less income.“Currently, they do not refill the tanks fully and they do not refill often like before. So, now, surviving is the best. An improvement would depend on the economic situation, especially since income has gone down and businesses have been shut down. Despite the recovery, mostly people use income that has just recovered to cover most necessary stuff. No need to talk about improvement yet,” he said.\n",

      "Investors from Thailand are mulling options to set up joint investments in Cambodia in some sectors, including processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, services, gems and jewellery.Around 60 businesspeople from Thailand visited Cambodia last week and the delegation held a discussion with the Minister of Industry Cham Prasidh.The business delegation termed its visit as a move to further enhance the business, trade and investment cooperation between both countries.Many investors from Thailand are looking at Cambodia’s potential for an export-orientated manufacturing base, considering that the Kingdom had entered into several free-trade agreements with several countries, including China and South Korea.According to experts, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) have provided wider exporting markets for the Kingdom. Cambodia’s total export to other RCEP member countries totalled $3.28 billion in the first half of 2022, up 10 percent year-on-year.Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, led the delegation to Cambodia in the first week of August.Angubolkul was quoted as saying in a Bangkok Post report that the delegation urged the government in Cambodia to help tackle obstacles to trade facilitation, in terms of rules and redundant regulations, to attract more foreign investment.Angubolkul pointed out that Cambodia has been witnessing an average annual economic growth of 7-8 percent because of the country’s foreign direct investment policy.Reiterating that the Kingdom has been looking at developing its tourism and agricultural sectors, he told the Bangkok newspaper, “This offers a very good opportunity for Thai businesses to forge joint investments with Cambodian counterparts in many sectors such as processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, the service sector, as well as gems and jewellery.”The delegation also proposed that the Thai government re-establish a rail link between Sa Kaeo’s Aranyaprathet district and Cambodia’s Poi Pet to facilitate cross-border trade and boost tourism around Thailand’s eastern border, according to the report.The rail link was halted following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.The bilateral trade between both countries surged around 23 percent to $2.297 billion in the first half of this year compared with $1.870 billion in the previous year, according to the data from the General Department of Customs and Excise.Exports to Thailand rose 36.7 per cent to $495.778 million while imports went up 19.5 per cent to $1.801 billion. However, Cambodia’s trade deficit with Thailand rose 14 percent to $1.306 billion during the period.Cambodia’s main exports to Thailand include textiles, agricultural products, gems, raw materials and semi-finished products.Major imports from Thailand are fish, meat, vegetables, automobiles, organic fertilisers, foodstuffs, and construction materials. \n",

      "Cambodia’s domestic cement production reached half of its full capacity in the January-June period of this year, according to a report from the Ministry of Mines and Energy.The report said yesterday that the cement produced locally was sufficient to meet the demand from the construction sector.Five cement factories in the Kingdom produced 4.6 million tonnes by July this year, the report stated, without referring to comparable figures from the first half of last year.“The five cement factories have a capacity of about nine million tonnes per year to supply for the building and construction sectors,” said Ung Dipola, general director of Mines, in a press conference at the Government Spokesman Unit.The report stated that the domestic cement factories produced 8.9 million tonnes last year, up from 8.5 million tonnes in 2020.Local cement production factories would support the prevailing demand, said Puth Chandarith, secretary-general of the Cambodian Cement Manufacturing Association.“The production of cement would be scaled up next year once the demand is high from construction projects,” he said.Four of the five factories in the country have been located in Kampot province while one is based in Battambang province.The sixth cement factory was launched in Kampong Speu province’s Oral district.Chinese company Conch KT Cement Co Ltd, which has completed a feasibility study on the plant, has been working on the necessary legal procedures to break ground, Kampong Speu governor Vei Samnang said recently.The imports of raw materials and construction materials to Cambodia have been valued at $1.27 billion in the first half of 2022, an increase of about 10 percent over the same period last year, according to a report from the National Bank of Cambodia.NBC said that the favourable domestic scenario, including the resumption of socio-economic activities in the country, coupled with the recovery of the global economy boosted exports, construction and real estate sectors.In 2021, Cambodia imported unspecific construction materials worth a total of $2.56 billion, from $2.02 billion in 2020.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129988/ifad-approach-designed-to-back-agriculture-master-plan/\n",
      "The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has said its projects are designed in line with the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries’ 2030 Agriculture Master Plan.The Master Plan is focussed on realising high-quality productive capacity and increasing the smallholder rural farmer productivity along with an increase in farmers’ income.It said the size of the IFAD country portfolio currently stands at $411 million and will grow to $775 million in the next five years to support the rural agriculture value chains in Cambodia.Following the impact surveys from different projects, it has been confirmed that the programme is able to increase smallholders’ returns by 25 percent in general.In response to the IFAD Country Program Strategy Evaluation, it was recognised that developing the rural economy is contingent on diverse interrelated conditions and factors that cannot be mitigated through one project.Following considerable opportunities for leveraging and building synergies among and between IFAD financed projects as well as those of other bilateral and multilateral financing and donor agencies, the programmatic approach to enhance the impact of investments on agriculture value chains for smallholders was adopted in 2019, it said.Based on the strong foundation, new pillars such as water investment and value chain financing, are being put in place. Under the pipeline projects, IFAD and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank are designing a $220 million investment project to support water investment through MoWRAM.Meng Sakphouseth, the Country Program Officer said that at a design level, the programmatic approach focuses on creating and strengthening synergies at the economic pole level through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms in which a diverse range of value chain stakeholders participate in order to define the interventions necessary to support and strengthen value chains.He further said, “At the project level, Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB’s) focusing on market linkages, production and value chains are collaboratively planned across projects.. and at the national level .. through a country program steering committee where all the projects meet to review progress, ensure more effective planning and holistic support targeted at rural communities through the alignment of production, marketing, as well as infrastructure support.”Sakphouseth added: “Most importantly at a beneficiary level, the practical developmental outcomes of this approach can enable rural people to obtain increased, sustainable incomes from market-led farming and from decent  remunerative employment.”The overall support results in the increase in the productive capacity of farmers by helping them get access to productive assets and skills, secondly, an increase in market efficiency through the aggregation of producers in agriculture cooperatives linked to value chains with growth potential and also an increase of sustainability, and reducing vulnerability to shocks by mainstreaming climate and environmental concerns, he said.A mechanism to ensure the full and timely exchange of information, constant program monitoring and evaluation and the consequent early and prompt addressing of technical matters across the projects, in line with the programmatic approach, has also been recently established in the form of a quarterly Technical Co-ordination Meeting (TCM), which is chaired on a rotating basis.\n",

      "Experts have stressed the need for curbing imports, boosting exports and inflow of remittances to minimize trade deficit and provide relief to Bangladesh’s forex reservesXinhua – The US dollar reached an all-time high against the Bangladeshi taka on Monday, soaring to 115 taka for the first time in the country’s kerb market trading history. On July 26 this year, the greenback reached 112 taka in the country’s open market for the first time. Subsequently, the rate hovered around 106 taka at the kerb market as authorities launched raids on money exchanger houses and the Bangladesh Bank (BB) intensified its monitoring.However, the fresh hike comes amid mounting economic pressure and speculation that the country is in dire need of foreign loan support.Increasing imports and a widening trade deficit were also cited as the possible reasons for taka depreciation.A BB official told Xinhua that the import bill in the last fiscal year 2021-22 increased to over 82 billion US dollars, fueling a persistent increase in the country’s trade deficit.“This is continuously increasing the pressure on the taka,” said the official who did not like to be named.Bangladesh’s trade deficit ballooned to a record level of over 33 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2021-22 which ended June 30 on the back of increased imports, showed the latest central bank data.According to the central bank data, the country’s import payment was 82.50 billion dollars, up 35.95 percent, in the last fiscal year, while earnings from exports stood at 49.25 billion dollars, up 33.45 percent, during the same period.Experts here in recent months have stressed the need for curbing imports, boosting exports and inflow of remittances to minimize trade deficit and provide relief to the country’s forex reserves. Weighed by higher import bills and the taka’s weakness driven by the dollar’s broad surge in recent months, Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserves last month fell below 40 billion dollars for the first time in two years.In its bid to boost the shrinking forex reserves, the BB has recently taken measures to discourage imports and woo more remittances from millions of Bangladeshi people living and working abroad.The Bangladeshi government last Thursday said it is contemplating taking loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as precautionary measures.Ahmad Kaikaus, principal secretary to the Bangladeshi prime minister, said the government did not seek a bailout, rather it is thinking of taking pragmatic steps in advance to address the upcoming or uncertain situation of the country due to the adverse impacts of the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.However, the concerned authorities such as the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Relations Division are holding discussions with the WB and ADB to take precautionary measures if the war continues, he continued. Replying to a query if  Bangladesh is taking loans like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he said the country’s statistics indicate that Bangladesh does not need loans as it has sufficient foreign reserves.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129994/experts-see-inflation-reprieve-in-america/\n",
      "AFP – Is inflation finally slowing down in the United States?Inflation data due to be released Wednesday is expected to show at least a partial cooling down of consumer prices and bring a breath of fresh air for US President Joe Biden just months before crucial midterm elections.Fueled by aggressive consumer spending of pandemic savings, global supply chain snarls, domestic worker shortages, and Russia’s war on Ukraine, inflation reached 9.1 percent in June, year over year, the highest in 40 years.But it is expected to fall to 8.6 percent in July, according to MarketWatch.White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said that although the administration has not seen the fresh statistics yet, “We know that gas prices have fallen.”“And we hope those gas price declines will factor into the CPI inflation data,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.Consumer prices have continued to climb in the United States, squeezing family budgets and, and by extension, Biden’s popularity.His opponents accuse Biden of precipitating inflation with his gigantic $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which he enacted in March last year, shortly after assuming office.And Republicans renewed their criticism of Biden’s economic policy, saying Sunday’s passage in the Senate of his massive climate and healthcare bill titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” does the opposite of its stated purpose.Larger issueBut the devil is in the details.Experts worry that the inflation slowdown linked to the drop in gasoline prices could be outweighed by rising rent and real estate prices.“The larger issue is what happens to home ownership costs & rents,” Diane Swonk, chief economist for KPMG, wrote on Twitter.Similar to other economists, Swonk expects to see a rise in the so-called underlying inflation rate that excludes food and energy, which had risen to 5.9 percent in June, year over year.The question now facing Washington is whether it will be possible to bring inflation down sustainably, without plunging the world’s largest economy into recession, after two quarters of economic contraction.In a bid to tamp down inflation, the US Federal Reserve has already hiked the interest rate four times to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent.On the bright side, the US labor market remains dynamic and in July the unemployment rate fell to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent.But there are still nearly two jobs open for every available worker, which pushes wages up and contributes to inflation.Inflation data will be released Wednesday at 8:30am local time (1230 GMT).\n",

      "A new collaboration programme on science, technology, and innovation (STI) is being developed, featuring Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam.The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said it was supporting the development of a new collaboration programme on science, technology, and innovation (STI) among the four South East Asian nations.This initiative is expected to establish a mutually beneficial partnership to tackle common challenges and opportunities for building scientific know-how, technological capabilities and innovation breakthroughs among the four countries.To fulfil the promise of STI to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, countries need concerted efforts to unlock the potential of scientific knowledge, digital technologies and business innovations, a ESCAP release said.ESCAP pointed out that the programme would identify specific areas, resources and institutional commitments to support strategic cooperation between the collaborating countries on STI.“STI cooperation and collaboration between neighbouring countries is essential if we wish to address collective challenges in the context of sustainable development,” said Kieth Rethy Chhem, Minister Delegate attached to Prime Minister and Secretary of State, Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation of Cambodia.Explaining the significance of the programme, Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, said, “To achieve the ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals, countries need to leverage science, technology and innovation. By facilitating south-south and triangular collaboration in this area, we hope to boost national innovation capabilities, tackle high-priority societal challenges and nurture shared prosperity.”Talking about Thailand’s Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model, Kitipong Promwong, President, Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO) of Thailand, said, “The government of Thailand has launched Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model or BCG as a new economic model aiming to promote inclusive and sustainable development on both national and regional scales. This collaboration programme will support our people and planet by amplifying the use of technological solutions and scientific knowledge for more sustainable economic models.”This initiative, adding to the Asia-Pacific Research and Training Network on STI Policy (ARTNETonSTI), will draw on a community of practice of government officials and policy experts to design forward-looking and evidence-based science, technology and innovation policies for inclusive and sustainable development, the release added. \n",

      "The ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’ project by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is set to boost job prospects in the agriculture sector.The agency, which launched the ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’ in the Kingdom recently, expects that the project would help create more than 3,000 jobs over a period of five years.USAID anticipates that the project would help generate $38 million in new private sector investments, help agriculture businesses and producers access $15 million in agriculture-related financing, and generate $100 million in sales.Veng Sakhon, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and US Ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy officially launched the new $25 million project on Monday.The project aims to promote sustainable, broad-based economic growth by increasing diversification and competitiveness in Cambodia’s agriculture sector.USAID said in a release that Harvest III is a five-year activity, funded by the US government’s Feed the Future initiative.“The US government has invested nearly $100 million over the past decade to improve both nutrition and family incomes in Cambodia by strengthening the country’s agriculture sector,” Murphy said in a statement.“In this global food crisis, it is critical that Cambodia strengthen its food security and Harvest III reflects the US government’s commitment towards this goal,” he added.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the project during his visit to Cambodia last week.USAID Harvest III would work with agriculture cooperatives, technology providers, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to develop a skilled workforce, create jobs, and capture market opportunities in the agriculture sector by working with the private sector.The project is expected to build on investments that USAID/Cambodia has already made promoting sustainable economic opportunities and climate-smart agriculture technologies. By collaborating with companies working in agricultural markets, the project intents to help improve livelihoods for Cambodians, especially women, youth, and marginalised populations, it pointed out.While announcing the project on August 4, Blinken said, “We believe in this programme, we believe in our partners, and we want to do much more good work together. It’s critical that we strengthen global food security and address the root causes of hunger, malnutrition, and poverty.”Since 2010, US agricultural investments in Cambodia through the USAID-led Feed the Future Initiative have helped 200,000 farmers increase their production and sales of fruits, vegetables, rice, and fish, and contributed to a 10 percent reduction in childhood stunting over the last eight years through improved, diversified diets, according to a report.The Kingdom’s agricultural exports surged 63.83 percent to 7,984,251.83 tonnes in 2021, from 3,110,790.73 tonnes in 2020.The country also generated revenue of $4,967,852,713, from exports last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture’s National Phytosanitary Database.The agricultural exports also reached 68 unique countries and territories in 2021 and the major products were milled and paddy rice, peppercorn, mangoes, bananas, cassava, corn and other vegetables.\n",

      "Thai businesses have set their sights on expanding trade and investment in Cambodia, especially in processed food, agriculture, tourism, renewable energy, plastic, and gems and jewellery.Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC), said Cambodia is seeing average economic growth of 7 – 8% per year as a result of the country opening up to foreign direct investment.Cambodia has been trying to develop its tourism and agricultural sectors, but the country still lacks sufficient knowledge and modern technology, especially in terms of storage and processing in order to increase values.This offers a very good opportunity for Thai businesses to forge joint investments with Cambodian counterparts in many sectors as above, according to Sanan, who is also chairman of the Board of Trade of Thailand. He led the first post-pandemic visit to Cambodia by more than 60 Thai businesses on August 4 – 5.The Thai business delegations also met with Cambodia’s Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Cham Prasidh. They urged the Cambodian government to help tackle obstacles to trade facilitation, in terms of rules and redundant regulations, to attract more foreign investment.Sanan said Cambodia is potentially capable of becoming an export-orientated manufacturing base for Thai investors now that the country has free-trade agreements with several countries, including China and the Republic of Korea.He added that the Thai business sector has also proposed that cooperation be focused on gems and jewellery, as well as education.According to Sanan, the business group also proposed that the Thai government re-establish a rail link between Sa Kaeo’s Aranyaprathet district and Cambodia’s Poi Pet to facilitate cross-border trade and boost tourism around Thailand’s eastern border.The rail link was halted following the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020.Two-way trade between Thailand and Cambodia totalled 7.97 billion USD in 2021, up 10.2% from a year before.Exports from Thailand accounted for 7.07 billion USD, and imports stood at 895 million USD.

      "Cambodia will generate its first revenue of about $18 million by selling nearly 3,000 barrels of crude oil to a Singaporean firm if the government approves the latest results of the negotiations between Cambodian officials, the shipment company and the buying firm, according to a senior official of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).Recently, Cambodian officials, World Tank, owner of MT-Strovolors and Singaporean oil buyer Trafigura have reached a consensus to bring back the oil Cambodia ‘lost’ last year, the official said.Meng Saktheara, secretary of state of MME, told Khmer Times yesterday that Trafigura had examined the quantity and quality of the oil stored on MT-Strovolors currently in Thailand after it was purchased from bankrupt KristEnergy that did not pay the shipment fee to World Tank.“The agency has already confirmed that there is no loss of quantity and quality of oil as the ship has maintained the oil very well,” said Saktheara, who is also the head of Block A Project Implementation.Saktheara said during a press conference that the oil was lost not due to corruption or collusion among government officials. “KrisEnergy had hired MT-Strovolors to store the oil, but the former breached the agreement by not paying the shipment fees so the latter needed to exercise its rights by keeping the oil till the payment is made.”“We expect that we will prepare a detailed agreement to be signed soon and conduct the negotiations. If Prime Minister Hun Sen agrees to the results, we will sign it shortly and bring the oil back and sell it,” said SakthearaKristEnergy was bankrupt when it hired MT-Strovolors to store the oil and ship it out of Block A of Cambodia. As the former was unable to pay shipment fees, the latter took the oil out seeking settlement of the fee.World Tank then cited weather conditions as an excuse to take the anchor off and set the ship on sail at night.At about 9 am the next day, captain of KristEnergy who stood by at the oil well platform informed Cambodian officials that the ship left secretly. The government then asked the navy to get the ship back, but it was too late as the ship had already entered Thailand waters.Later it left for Indonesia and Bangladesh as well despite the best efforts of Cambodia to bring the ship back.“Even though we tried legal ways to get the ship back, we failed. But we continued the efforts through negotiations based on international laws,” Saktheara said.\n",

      "Cambodia slipped one rank in the latest Nikkei Global Covid-19 Recovery Index but held the second rank as the country’s economy continues to bounce back vigorously from the clutches of the pandemic.With 78 points, the Middle East nation Bahrain now tops the index for July and Cambodia is just behind with 77.5 points. The index having 121 countries lists eastern Caribbean island Barbados at the last with just 39 points.Cambodia was ranked first in the index last June, following a wide array of measures adopted by the country to beat Covid-19, including the massive vaccination campaigns and the early reopening of the economy.At the last count by July end, Cambodia vaccinated 15,116,378 (at least one dose) of its estimated 16 million people since the vaccination campaign began on February 10, 2021, covering 94.48 percent of the population so far.The Kingdom is also among the first in the region to reopen for business with its widely acclaimed ‘Live with Covid-19’ policy. The country had ended most of its Covid-19 restrictions as early as November 2021 and a majority of the businesses reopened then.The Nikkei index assesses countries and regions on infection management, vaccine rollouts and social mobility. The higher the ranking, the closer an area is to recovery, characterized by lower infection and death rates and better inoculation coverage, as well as fewer movement restrictions.Data sources for the index included Our World in Data, Google Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports, Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, flight data firm Cirium and Nikkei Asia research.Meanwhile, some of the Asian giants had massive fall this time compared to the June index with Japan plunging 60 places to 90th, as the omicron subvariant BA.5 is spreading in the country with more daily cases than anywhere else in the world.South Korea, also reporting a jump in infections, slipped to 13th from fourth on the Nikke’s index. In the Asia-Pacific region, apart from Cambodia, Vietnam too continued to rank high at fourth. Taiwan rose 33 spots, with cases and deaths falling, and is positioned at 79th rank now.Bahrain’s government attributed its top ranking to its successful Covid-19 mitigation efforts, including the increase in vaccination rollout and full adherence to health precautionary measures.Globally, Japan, the United States and South Korea reported the most Covid-19 cases in the last week of July, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Japan saw 1.38 million infections, a 42 percent increase from the previous week, while South Korea reported more than 560,000, up 25 percent, for the same period.In Japan, government experts attributed the latest wave in the infections to the highly contagious yet less deadly BA.5 subvariant. Over 63 percent of Japanese have been triple vaccinated and 30 percent of those aged 60 or above have received a fourth shot.BA.5 is now the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, with a prevalence rate of 69.6 percent, according to the WHO.Meanwhile, Cambodia reported 25 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, bringing the total cases to 137,081. No deaths were reported, keeping the total to 3,056 direct deaths from Covid-19 in the country. There were 54 recoveries recorded.There are now 264 active Covid-19 cases in the Kingdom.\n",

Many of the ministers and delegation used the occasion to visit some of the popular tourist destinations in the country.Siem Reap again emerged as the top spot for visitors due to the interest among the tourists to visit the world-famous Angkor Wat.The other places of interest for tourists during the last week were the provinces of Preah Sihanouk, Kampot, Kep, Battambang, and the capital Phnom Penh.While Siem Reap received 39,979 tourists, Preah Sihanouk attracted 33,837 visitors, followed by Kampot (33,461), Kep (20,057), and Battambang (19,688) from August 6 to August 7.Phnom Penh remained one of the top destinations in the country with the capital attracting 18,734 tourists during the weekend.While Kampong Speu received 12,199 travellers during the period, Pursat and Kandal attracted 11,999 and 11,085 tourists, respectively.The Kingdom expects to attract one million international tourists this year, tourism minister Thong Khon said last month.The country received 510,000 foreign visitors in the first half of this year, a whooping increase of 394 percent compared to the same period last year.Vietnam and Thailand were the largest sources of tourists to the country.“We hope to attract around one million foreign tourists in 2022 and up to two million in 2023,” Khon said.Tourism, one of the four pillars supporting the Kingdom’s economy, is forecast to reach its pre-Covid level in 2026 or 2027.In the pre-pandemic era, Cambodia received 6.6 million international tourists in 2019, generating $4.92 billion in revenue.Cambodia was also one of the first countries in Asean that had reopened its borders and eased travel restrictions for international travellers.The Ministry of Tourism and the provincial and municipal tourism departments continued to enforce safety standard operating procedures to prevent the possible transmission of Covid-19, a statement said.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501129255/covid-19-gambling-ban-leave-sville-biz-sulking/\n",
      "Covid-19 and the ban on online gambling have left several businesses in Cambodia’s coastal city Sihanoukville sulking with over 1,500 multi-million building projects reportedly abandoned midway by investors.The city had a thriving gambling business from 2015 to 2019, but the government suddenly clamped a ban on it in August 2019, forcing many of the investors in the business to leave the country.The ban was followed by Covid-19, leading to the further flight of Chinese investors, sources in the real estate sector told Khmer Times.Seeking a solution to their grievances, several developers reportedly met with provincial government officials in early July, with the hope the authorities will provide tax relief and create a land-value index to help with lease negotiations.They had also sought the government’s help to resolve disputes with landlords by persuading the latter to become stakeholders in the projects.In recent weeks, the city also witnessed a couple of violent crimes forcing the provincial governor Kuoch Chamroeun to warn that in the event of shootings, abductions, drug use and other crimes at casinos and other businesses, strict measures will be enforced including shutting down the establishment.He warned that provincial authorities would not only shut down the business but also ask the government to revoke the business licence.Some residents, meanwhile, are of the view that Sihanoukville’s fortunes began to change on June 22, 2019 after a construction site collapse that left 28 workers dead and 26 injured.Meanwhile, the government is all the more determined to develop Sihanoukville as a model city and is in the process of completing an ambitious masterplan to turn the city into a commercial and logistics hub, besides a tourism hotspot.Edward Lee, CEO of Prince Real Estate, told Khmer Times that the issue in Sihanoukville now was not about investors leaving but more about not able to come back yet as quite a number of those projects are owned by investors from China and China has still not fully reopened due to its ‘Zero Covid-19’ policy.“For the last three years, due to Covid, many projects have been temporarily stopped in Sihanoukville, but some will be reactivated for sure. Overall, Cambodia’s real estate sector is recovering faster than its neighbours,” he said.Lor Vichet, Phnom Penh President of Global Real Estate Association said Sihanoukville was chosen for gambling business by some Philippine investors too after the former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte took a tough stance against the practice.“In Cambodia, licences were easy to get to start casinos and some of them took advantage of it,” he said, adding that real estate prices too suddenly rose in the city. “But after the ban on online gambling by Cambodian government, these businesses left the country,” he noted, leaving the unfinished constructions as well.But Tom O’Sullivan, CEO of realestate.com.kh felt that it is not all that bad in Sihanoukville. “The authorities need time to clean up some of the mess left by these gamblers,” he said. \n",

      "Despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bilateral trade between Cambodia and Thailand showed significant growth in the last three years.During a courtesy meeting between the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Business Commission last week, commerce minister Pan Sorasak urged Thai investors in Cambodia to become more active in promoting trade and investment.Chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce Sanan Angubolkul said, “The purpose of the Thai Chamber of Commerce delegation’s current visit was to increase trade opportunities and expand the market network through high-quality trade fairs, especially in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). In addition, this trade visit and trade fair play an important role in connecting with business partners in Cambodia, such as the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce as well as trade associations to invite Cambodian-Thai businessmen to meet in order to strengthen and expand trade relations as well as increase trade volume between Cambodia and Thailand.”Lim Heng, Vice President of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce (CCC), said that the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Chamber of Commerce have been working closely to promote business matching between the two countries to ensure the flow of business and investment.  This meeting will also include business matching between the two countries, which will bring mutual benefits for both parties.He also encouraged all traders and investors to actively participate and find more of their investment partners for mutual benefit and to achieve fruitful results in the future.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce also asked the chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce to help promote some important business activities, including the Organize Cambodia-Thailand trade mission. Moreover, they should participate in the Cambodia Expo, which is held annually in Phnom Penh and organised by the Ministry of Commerce of Cambodia; and participate in business forums to strengthen trade and investment relations between Cambodia and Thailand.Bilateral trade between Cambodia and Thailand rose 22.8 percent to $2.297 billion in the first half of 2022 from $1.870 billion a year ago, according to the General Department of Customs and Excise.

      "Cambodia’s largest local commercial bank Acleda Bank Plc continued the operations of its subsidiaries Acleda Bank Lao Ltd (ABL) and Acleda MFI Myanmar Co Ltd (AMM) in June this year even as they are confronted by some pressing economic, political and pandemic environment challenges, according to the bank’s report.Lao PDR’s inflation increased from under 2 percent in February 2021 to 9.9 percent in April 2022 and threatened living standards, especially in low-income urban households. The fiscal deficit declined in 2021, driven by higher domestic revenue and spending curbs despite domestic revenue rebounding to 12.4 percent of GDP in 2021 as it has remained below pre-pandemic levels and the regional average.As the Lao economy began its recovery from the effects of the worldwide slowdown caused by COVID-19, the country faced challenges caused by long-standing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including rising global commodity prices and sharp exchange rate depreciation, the report added.High debt-service obligations and low revenue levels continued to limit the fiscal space for critical investment in human capital. Public debt levels have increased considerably since 2019, endangering macroeconomic stability, the report read, adding that policy options were available to mitigate these threats.“The government has pledged to take stronger action to manage currency exchange rates and address fuel shortage and debts owed to private companies and foreign countries. The pledge is part of the government’s continuing efforts to fulfil the goals of the two national agendas, which seek to ease the country’s economic and financial difficulties and curb drug trafficking,” the report pointed out.“Raising the reserve requirement means that the central bank can reduce money supply, which should enable it to better control money supply and curb inflation, as well as respond to the nation’s economic woes,” the report stated, adding that as at 30 June 2022, Covid-19 outbreak since the last 3 years has been much recovered.“During the last serious outbreak, most clients of the bank requested to delay payment and can pay some amount of monthly loan repayment… therefore, ABL has set strategy for solving loan default and action plan to improve the quality of loan portfolio,” the report said.As of 30 June 22, the exchange rate still fluctuated and impacted the ABL performance, but in terms of Lao Kip currency, loan outstanding is still over plan around 1 percent. Loan default has 7.24 percent decrease compared to March 22 due to the collection rate increased. So far, ABL still has the ability to pay its debt, and liquidity and cash flow are still in a good position.Myanmar’s economy and people are undergoing the impact of the political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic cases since 2021. These protests and movements caused temporary disruptions in the business operations across Myanmar including other key services including electricity, logistics and digital connectivity and led to much fluctuation in exchange rate.Until this June 2022, due to the vaccination enforcement, protective and preventive measures against the COVID-19 from government and the people, the COVID-19 cases in Myanmar have drastically declined, and to develop tourism sector and facilitate the entries of foreigners, the government lifted the ban on foreign visitors with few public health requirements by allowing international passenger flights to operate as normal after suspension for over two years.As at 30 June 2022, some business activities have started resuming operations including the local and international trade imports and exports, the manufacturing sector output and employment also appeared to be stabilising, and exports have recovered in recent months.\n",

      "The solid relationship with China has provided great benefits to Cambodia’s socio-economic development and poverty reduction, a Cambodian academic said on Monday.Senior economist Ky Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said China is the largest donor, investor and trading partner of Cambodia, and that the ties between the two countries are currently “as solid as the Great Wall of China.”“Chinese aid and investment have played a very important role in supporting Cambodia’s socio-economic development and poverty reduction through creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” he told Xinhua.Sereyvath said under the Belt and Road Initiative, China has helped build many mega-projects such as roads, bridges, ports, airports, hydropower plants, economic zones, and a national stadium in the Southeast Asian nation.The expert noted three remarkable Chinese invested projects in Cambodia, namely the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, the first ever Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville expressway, and the new Siem Reap Angkor International Airport. “These projects have provided and will continue to provide great benefits to Cambodia.”Moreover, he said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, both of which entered into force in January, have been giving a big boost to Cambodia’s economic growth.“The two free trade agreements have provided larger market access for made-in-Cambodia products, and there is no doubt that Cambodia’s exports to China and other RCEP countries will be bigger and bigger in the future,” he said.Sereyvath also highlighted the growing China-Cambodia relations, saying that the ties have withstood the test of regional and international vicissitudes and grown even stronger since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1958.He said the two countries upgraded their relations to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in December 2010 and bilateral ties are currently at an all-time high.“The iron-clad friendship between Cambodia and China is made based on mutual trust, respect, help and support,” he said. “The ties between the two countries should serve as a role model of country-to-country relations.”Sharing his view on the future of China-Cambodia relations, Sereyvath said bilateral ties would continue to deepen.“Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have not only protected millions of Cambodian people’s lives and stabilized the health system, but also helped boost Cambodia’s economic recovery,” he said.Buoyed by its high vaccination rate, Cambodia has resumed all socio-economic activities with confidence and reopened its borders to travelers without quarantine since last November.“The Sino-Cambodian ties are currently very stable and unbreakable, and I think that the relations will be closer and stronger in the future, especially in politics, economics, trade, investment, tourism, culture and agriculture,” he said.

Tourists can watch a performance, showing off local customs, folk galas of Southeast Asian countries, and even appreciate magnificent sceneries of ASEAN countries in a cinema equipped with a giant hemispherical screen.Jon Aquino, an Indonesian student from Guangxi Minzu University, was impressed by the Indonesian and Thai-style buildings and Indonesian song and dance performances. “I really want to join the dance,” he said.Namdet On Anong, a Thai teacher at Guangxi University of Foreign Languages, loved the park’s high-tech ride show based on the Thai Ramakien, the National Epic of Thailand.“Technology really empowers cultural tourism. We sit on the dynamic rail car and can easily relate to this story. Many Chinese tourists around me were also attracted to the charm of Thai culture,” Namdet On Anong said. “It feels like I’m back in my hometown. It’s very warm and makes me miss home.”Lu Xiaoli from Guangdong Province brought her family to take a special photo with “Cambodian Angkor Wat” in the park, along with other landmarks of Southeast Asian countries, as the pandemic has made overseas travelling less convenient than before.“The park uses technologies to give tourists a better experience, which is like a mini trip to those countries,” she said.Hu Yang, marketing director of Fantawild, said this year’s tourist rush came earlier than usual, as the daily visitor volume exceeded 10,000, and the daily reception of out-of-town tour groups hit more than 30.“Tourism innovation has become even more important. The industry should pay more\n",

      "Energy efficiency can create 500K jobs in Cambodia\n",
      "August 9, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128444/energy-efficiency-can-create-500k-jobs-in-cambodia/\n",
      "As many as 500,000 additional jobs can be created in Cambodia by 2030 through energy efficiency measures and a family living in Phnom Penh can cut up to $545 annually from the electricity bills through effective energy saving methods, said a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study.In a report titled “Green Economic Growth in Cambodia As A Covid-19 Response”, UNDP said the steps for energy efficiency will also contribute to the government’s effort in making electricity affordable through tariff reduction.In the case of households, electricity bills can be substantially reduced by using power more efficiently, for example through efficient appliances and better-insulated buildings, the study said.“An urban middle-class household in Phnom Penh could reduce their electricity bill by $545 a year by using efficient LEED lighting and energy-labelled refrigeration and cooling equipment,” the report pointed out. An added attraction is that the money saved in electricity costs can be used for purposes such as education and health. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy efficiency is the first step toward a sustainable global energy system. Investments in energy efficiency have also one of the highest job creation potentials out of all sustainable Covid-19 recovery measures.\n",
      "Even before the Covid-19 crisis, more than 3.3 million people held jobs in the energy efficiency industry in the US and Europe alone. Most of them were employed by small and medium-sized businesses.In the case of Cambodia, more than 500,000 additional jobs could be created by 2030 if the country follows the green industry scenario, the study said.Establishing a National Energy Management System (EMS) can also help industries reduce their electricity cost and build capacities of the local workforce, creating new jobs such as energy managers or auditors.Promoting energy management and other energy-efficient technologies in major industries (including garment, brick, food and beverage) with an estimated investment of $90 million will result in saving of $276 million until 2030, the report said.Adopting energy efficiency measures in large-scale public infrastructure investment areas can also generate more jobs. For instance, India’s Street Lighting National Programme has upgraded around 11 million streetlights with efficient LEDs and generated 13,000 jobs, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by five million tonnes per year, the report said.The UNDP recommendations for Cambodia include converting public buildings to highly energy efficient, promoting low-energy consuming affordable housing, green city concept for reducing the urban heat island effect, smart and energy-efficient public street lighting, smart electric grids and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, public transport infrastructure and creation of cycling lanes and pedestrian zones.Regarding the financing options for energy-efficient projects, the report said the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working closely with the Ministry of Mining Energy (MME) to assess the energy-efficient market and it has supported the finalisation of the National Energy Efficiency Policy (NEEP).In this context, ADB has also shown willingness to provide loans to Cambodia’s government to develop a sustainable energy efficiency market. Once the NEEP is in place, other international development banks and funds might also be willing to join.Another vehicle for loans could be the ‘Green Financing Institution’ developed by Mekong Partners with USAID and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The Green Financing Institution is envisaged to support and enable Cambodia’s shift towards a greener economy and society.Issuing green bonds can also be effective as a financing method. A green bond is a fixed-income instrument designed to support specific climate-related or environmental projects. Green bonds typically come with tax incentives to enhance their attractiveness to investors.The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently finalised economic modelling of green recovery measures in response to the Covid-19 crisis. It found that energy efficiency in buildings and industry, together with solar energy, creates the most jobs per million dollars of investment. On average, these measures create between 10 and 15 jobs for every one million dollars invested, the report said.According to EnergyLab Cambodia, solar power is now the cheapest available form of electricity in the world and by removing the over-reliance on costly oil and coal-fired power plants and raising power generation from renewable sources including solar to 35 percent of total power by 2040, Cambodia can ensure a secure energy future for the next generation.“Cambodia has over 40GW of solar power potential and excellent irradiation resources,” Bridget McIntosh, founder of EnergyLab Cambodia told Khmer Times, while urging the government not to go ahead with the proposed coal plants. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128520/japans-softbank-reports-record-quarterly-net-loss/\n",
      "AFP – Japan’s SoftBank Group on Monday reported a record quarterly net loss of $23.4 billion, after central bank interest rate hikes caused tech shares to tank.The telecoms firm that has turned into an investment behemoth posted a net loss of 3.16 trillion yen, nose-diving from a net profit of 761.5 billion yen in the same April-June period the previous year.A weaker yen and the “global downward trend in share prices due to growing concerns over economic recession driven by inflation and rising interest rates” contributed to the slump, it said. Among its portfolio companies that suffered large losses for the quarter were South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang and US meal delivery platform DoorDash, SoftBank added.SoftBank’s big stakes in tech giants and volatile new ventures have made for unpredictable earnings, and it has lurched between record highs and lows in recent years.In May, it reported its worst-ever full-year net loss – and a then-record quarterly loss for Q4 – after a bruising year in 2021-22 that saw its assets hit by a US tech share rout and a regulatory crackdown in China.That came after logging Japan’s biggest-ever annual net profit in 2020-21, after people moved their lives online during the pandemic, sending tech stocks soaring.And in 2019-20, SoftBank Group reported a then-record annual net loss of 961.6 billion yen, as the emergence of Covid-19 compounded woes caused by its investment in troubled office-sharing start-up WeWork.Hideki Yasuda, senior analyst at Toyo Securities, told AFP the company “cannot help” big losses, “because the market is down”.“They have to wait for the market to rebound. You have to look at the company through the lens of long-term investment. It may experience one or two bad years, but over a decade or more, the world economy will keep growing and it could grow further.” \n",

      "Banks, MFIs raise interest rates following Fed move\n",
      "August 9, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128445/banks-mfis-raise-interest-rates-following-fed-move/\n",
      "Many banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Cambodia have increased interest rates for deposits in dollar and riel currency by approximately 0.5 percent and 1 percent per annum respectively but not decreased rates for loans in the last three months, according to senior officials in the industry.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US central bank Federal Reserve raised the target range for federal funds — benchmark interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to other financial institutions — to a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent.Sok Voeun, chairman of Cambodia Microfinance Institution (CMA), told Khmer Times that about 40 percent of total investment capital in five microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDI) are loans from overseas and local lenders, while the rest are from public deposits or savings. General MFIs get loans from only overseas and local lenders to use as capital.“There must be a relationship and effect regarding the interest rate. Actually, we also have sources of capital from the US and Europe. When their central banks raise interest rates for commercial banks, while our lenders also get loans from those banks or management funds, they have to pay more interest to those institutions,” Voeun said.“Our overseas lenders have to charge us higher interest rates so that they can maintain margin at a proper level. That’s why we as the borrowers need to raise a bit more to be consistent,” Voeun said, adding that both banks and MFIs in the Kingdom will also increase interest rates for loans in the future if the interest rate for loans from overseas financial sources continues to rise.Voeun, who is also the CEO of LOLC (Cambodia) Plc, one of the five MDIs in Cambodia, went on to add that banks and MFIs have increased interest rates for deposit products in riel higher than the rate for dollar as those financial institutions have been facing a shortage of riel banknotes.“Raising interest rates is not good as it would affect the economy. Not only institutions but also financial service consumers because they have to pay higher spending on interest. We do not raise interest for loans but if the situation is like this, we will raise it,” he said, adding that banks generally have a small percentage of foreign loans in their capital.Neav Sokun, Chief Operating Officer at Small and Medium Enterprise Bank of Cambodia Plc (SME Bank), told Khmer Times that he also has noticed the new uptrend of interest rates among banks and MFIs in the Kingdom since March or April this year.“The US central bank has increased its key lending rates two times. SME Bank — operated with the technical and financial guidance of the Ministry of Economic and Finance — has not raised the interest rate yet,” he said.Cambodia currently has 58 commercial banks, nine specialised banks, and 86 microfinance institutions, with a total of 2,614 headquarters and branches as well as 3,998 automated teller machines (ATMs) throughout the country, according to the latest report of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) released late July.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128453/3-day-asean-online-shopping-fest-kicks-off/\n",
      "The three-day Asean Online Sale Day (AOSD) began yesterday with the participation of nearly 500 businesses, marking the 55th Asean Day.Organised by the Asean Coordinating Committee on E-commerce (ACCEC) from August 8 to 10, the annual online shopping event brings together the best of Asean businesses, goods and services across the region on a single platform.Consumer goods, electronics, food and beverages, cosmetics and beauty products and tourism and travel packages are made available on the e-platform onlineasean.com along with several other products and services as part of the event. Special discounts are also offered, said a release.The AOSD, which started in 2020, is meant to encourage regional digital trade and enhance stronger collaboration between stakeholders, including government agencies, the private sector, business associations and consumers, to explore new policy initiatives and to advance innovative technologies in the promotion of cross-border e-commerce activities.The two main groups of AOSD 2022 activities are domestic e-commerce shopping and cross-border e-commerce shopping.Asean’s e-commerce sector is expected to triple in size from $100 billion to $300 billion by 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic has further boosted this trend of e-commerce adoption, the release noted.It is estimated that in Southeast Asia, 40 million people came online for the first time in 2021 alone, bringing the internet penetration in the region to 75 percent. Consumption of digital services has remained strong more than a year into the pandemic – a trend that will likely continue. The total number of internet users in the region has grown to 440 million, up from 250 million in 2015.This year, AOSD hopes to further accelerate these trends and encourage consumers and businesses to engage in e-commerce across the region. The initiative also serves to reinforce and position the role of e-commerce and digital integration as a key driver of Asean’s economic growth. It complements ongoing Asean member states’ efforts to encourage digitalization among businesses.In 2020, more than 200 e-commerce businesses in Asean participated in AOSD and offered a large range of goods and services at promotional or discounted rates through their e-commerce platforms. The event continued to grow in 2021, with the participation of more than 350 businesses, the release said. \n",

      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement among 15 Asia-Pacific nations, will stimulate economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, Prime Minister Hun Sen said yesterday.Delivering a video message to mark the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Day, the premier said the agreement will help create jobs, and strengthen the supply chain in the region and the world as a whole.Mr Hun Sen also pointed out that the full and effective implementation of the RCEP agreement is a priority.“As the Chair of ASEAN 2022, Cambodia will work closely with RCEP countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the RCEP Agreement to further intensify the facilitation of cross-border trade movements,” the Prime Minister said.He also pointed out that Asean’s long-term growth and prosperity will depend on its resilience in re-boosting regional economic recovery and growth.“We need to put more efforts to implement a broad spectrum of initiatives ranging from industrial transformation, digitalisation, and innovation to integration of the global supply chains, digital economy and e-commerce. We need to push for a more vibrant and harmonious Asean Community by seeking more protection for our migrant workers and increasing support for green and inclusive development agenda and the UN SDGs targets. In the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we have no choice but to enable the digital transformation of our women and youth entrepreneurship,” he added.The RCEP, which came into force in January this year, comprises 10 Asean member states – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – and their five trading partners: China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.According to an Asean foreign ministers’ joint communique released recently, RCEP would be a key contributor to the recovery strategy of Asean.“The RCEP would make a significant contribution to our recovery strategy and continue to support an inclusive and open trade and investment architecture in the region,” the communique, which was released during the 55th Asean foreign ministers’ meeting in Phnom Penh, said.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 55th AMM last week, Mr Hun Sen proposed the establishment of a standalone secretariat in Cambodia to maximize the potential of the RCEP.“Cambodia is ready to host this RCEP secretariat. We have even thought of where in Phnom Penh the secretariat should be located, while we are working to formulate our detailed proposal. I hope Cambodia can win the support of fellow Asean member states, as well as all RCEP participating countries when we submit our proposal officially,” he said.Reflecting the significance of RCEP in boosting the regional economy, Cambodia’s total export to other member countries of RCEP rose 10 percent year-on-year to reach $3.28 billion in the first half of 2022.According to the Ministry of Commerce report last month, Cambodia’s top three export destinations during the period were Vietnam, China and Japan.The Kingdom shipped products worth $1.17 billion to Vietnam, $612 million to China and $542 million to Japan, the report indicated.According to China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the RCEP is expected to boost global trade by nearly three percent, with a 1.5 percent global growth effect in five years.Meanwhile, an Asian Development Bank’s study said the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 percent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment.\n",

      "In a major boost for the expansion of a new container terminal at the Sihanoukville Port, Cambodia received a 41,388,000,000 yen ($306 million) loan from Japan.At a function presided over by Prime Minister Hun Sen at the Peace Palace on Saturday, Prak Sokhonn, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and his Japanese counterpart Hayashi Yoshimasa exchanged notes and related documents on the extension of the loan.In line with the commitment made by the prime ministers of both countries earlier this year, the new loan will help Cambodia expand and modernise its Sihanoukville Autonomous Port into a principal deep-sea port in the Kingdom and region.Hem Vanndy, secretary of state at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Kamei Haruko, Chief Representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Cambodia office, signed the actual\n",
      "loan agreement.Before the signing ceremony, Yoshimasa paid a courtesy call on Mr Hun Sen and they lauded the good relationship between the countries.The Prime Minister thanked the government and people of Japan for their assistance in the development of Cambodia.Yoshimasa said he would continue to work together with his Cambodian counterpart Sokhonn to further boost Cambodia-Japan relations and cooperation, mainly in the fields of economy, investment, national defence, and other areas.Last March, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio visited Cambodia and the two prime ministers issued a joint statement outlining the direction of future cooperation. The leaders agreed to work together to make Sihanoukville a major port, located in the southwestern province of Preah Sihanouk, for Cambodia and the Mekong region.The listed seaport, the sole international and commercial deep-sea port in Cambodia, made a gross revenue of $93.2 million in 2021, up 17.6 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport.The port handled 6.9 million tonnes of containerized cargos last year, up six percent year-on-year, the ministry added.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport announced that it was developing and modernising new container ports through a study with JICA.Currently, the port can handle ships with a depth of more than 9 m and the new expansion plans help it provide services to larger ships.According to earlier reports, the container terminal port project is scheduled to start in late 2025, while the project’s phases 2 and 3 will commence in 2028 and 2029, respectively.The first phase of the container terminal is 350 metres long and 14.5 metres in depth while the second phase is 350 metres long and 16.5 metres in depth. Both the projects are scheduled to be completed in 2028 while phase 3, which is 400 metres long and 17.5 metres in depth, is scheduled to be completed in 2029.The new container terminals are being built to cater to the growing throughputs of containers and goods at the port.Currently, the port has been handling containers and goods beyond its capacity. It now handles 750,000 TEUs of containers, while the port’s capacity is 700,000 TEUs of containers.Once three container terminal projects are operational, the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port can handle the deadweight tonne containers.Sihanoukville Autonomous Port recorded a net profit of $5.9 million for the fourth quarter in 2021 due to an increase in container throughput and foreign exchange gains.PAS has also posted a 4.21 percent increase in revenue at more than $21 million in the fourth quarter, as against a revenue of $864,729 for the same quarter in 2020.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501128517/markets-mixed-as-strong-us-jobs-data-fans-fed-rate-hike-bets/\n",
      "AFP – Markets were mixed Monday and the dollar held big gains as a blockbuster US jobs report ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will announce more sharp interest rate hikes as it tries to tame runaway inflation.While the employment reading – which was more than twice as high as expected – indicated the world’s top economy remained resilient despite rising prices and borrowing costs, it will complicate the central bank’s plans to tighten monetary policy.Traders have hoped that with several indicators pointing to a slowdown, including GDP figures showing a technical recession, policymakers could begin to ease back on their pace of rate hikes.Now, speculation is growing that the Fed will have to announce a third successive 75 basis-point increase next month, particularly as officials have said their decisions will be data-dependent.“Friday’s payroll report indicates an overheated labour market that continues to tighten further,” said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.“Hence at minimum, the markets expect another 100 basis points of Fed funds rate increases over the next three meetings… with risks skewed towards significant increases.”All eyes are now on the release this week of US July inflation data, which is expected to show a slight slowdown from June but still at four-decade highs.The “report seems very unlikely to offer ‘compelling evidence’ of a slowdown needed for the Fed to pull away from its aggressive inflation-fighting mode”, Innes added.The jobs figures left Wall Street’s main indexes mixed Friday, and Asia followed suit with markets fluctuating in early trade.However, there was some relief that tensions had calmed since US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last week sparked a furious reaction from China, including live-fire military drills around the island that continued Monday.Hong Kong fell, with little excitement generated by news that the city will cut the amount of time incoming travellers must spend in hotel quarantine.Singapore, Taipei, Bangkok, Jakarta and Wellington were also down, but Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai and Manila edged up.Shanghai was boosted by better-than-expected Chinese trade data, though the gains were tempered by fresh worries about Covid lockdowns in the country that threaten the economic recovery.London, Frankfurt and Paris rose in the morning.Oil demand concernsThe prospect of higher interest rates sent the dollar surging, and it held on to those gains in Asia.Oil rose but bets on a recession across leading economies continued to fuel concerns about demand – figures last week indicated Americans were driving less now than in summer 2020 at the height of the pandemic.A rise in US stockpiles was partly responsible for a 10 percent drop in the commodity last week, pushing WTI below $90 for the first time since February.Both main contracts have lost all the gains seen in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which led the United States and Europe to ban imports of Russian crude, hammering already thin supplies.Fresh talks on Iran’s nuclear programme were being followed.“The resumption of Iran nuclear talks… is one potential downside risk for the oil price, given the ability of the country to quickly ramp up production if a deal is struck,” said OANDA’s Craig Erlam.“Not to mention its reportedly large oil and gas reserves. A deal could apparently be struck within days, although we have heard that a lot at times this year.”\n",

AFT held about 26 percent of the ABC shares as of 2021.“I think AFT is making a good investment as ABC is making good profit and offering handsome dividend yield as well,” she added.The total trading value of ABC stock also rocketed to about $73.76 million, accounting for about 96 percent of the total trading value of CSX in the April-June period this year, according to the CSX report for Quarter 2.ABC has also seen its traded shares rising to about 26.2 million – over 90 percent of the total trade volume on the CSX as a whole – in the second quarter of this year.Cambodia’s largest local commercial bank ACLEDA recently added about 65 million shares, legalised from ASA Plc in mid-June of last year, which comes to about 15 percent of its total shares.\n",

      "AFP – Four more ships loaded with grain set off from Ukrainian ports on Sunday, as Moscow and Kyiv blamed each other for a new strike at a Russian-occupied nuclear plant.Odessa regional authorities, meanwhile, announced that another two grain shipments were due to leave on Monday.Kyiv’s infrastructure ministry wrote on Telegram on Sunday that a convoy of Ukrainian supplies had left, with three ships departing from Chornomorsk and one from Odessa.The Mustafa Necati, the Star Helena, the Glory and the Riva Wind were carrying “around 170,000 tonnes of agriculture-related merchandise”, it said.The spokesman for the Odessa regional military administration said early Monday morning that the MV Sacura and MV Arizona had also been cleared to set sail. It would “transport 59,000 tonnes of food via the maritime humanitarian corridor today”, he said.‘A suicidal thing’Moscow and Kyiv traded accusations on Sunday over who bombed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site in southern Ukraine.

      "power complex has been under Russian control since the early days of the February 24 invasion.Recent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.Russia’s occupying authorities in the town of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, said the Ukrainian army overnight “carried out a strike with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan multiple rocket launcher”.The projectiles fell “within 400 metres of a working reactor” and in a “zone storing used nuclear fuel”, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported.Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Enerhoatom, however, said the “Russian occupiers once again fired rockets at the nuclear power plant (and) its host town, Enerhodar”.AFP was not able to confirm the allegations from an independent source.Without assigning blame, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike in remarks from Tokyo on Monday morning.“Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing. I hope that those attacks will end, and at the same time I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant,” he said.On Saturday, Enerhoatom had already said parts of the facility had been “seriously damaged” by military strikes the previous day, forcing the shutdown of one of its reactors.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in his nightly address Sunday, called for a “principled response” from the international community.Evoking the possibility that the plant was hit causing the release of a toxic cloud, he added: “No one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination.”Amnesty’s regretAmnesty International on Sunday said it deeply regretted the “distress and anger” caused after it alleged Ukrainian forces were flouting international law by exposing civilians to Russian fire, but stood by its controversial report.The Thursday report, which sparked outrage in Ukraine, accused the military of endangering civilians by establishing bases in schools and hospitals, and launching counter-attacks from heavily populated areas.Meanwhile, the renewed shipments of Ukrainian grain to help ease global food shortages and bring down prices offered a small glimmer of hope as the war entered its sixth month.Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, had been forced to halt almost all deliveries in the wake of Russia’s invasion.That sent global food prices soaring, making imports prohibitively expensive for some of the world’s poorest nations.A bulk carrier arrived in Chornomorsk on Saturday to be loaded with grain for the first time since Moscow’s invasion.The departure Sunday of the four other vessels, along with Monday’s planned departure of two more, came after several others set sail last week under a deal brokered with the help\n",

      "The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has started to set the official exchange rate for the dollar based on the foreign exchange buying and selling prices in the currency market from August 2.NBC announced that the official exchange rate on the National Bank of Cambodia Platform (NBCP) is based on the exchange rate in the currency market the previous day and is to be set every morning.“This is because NBCP is highly active now with many banking and financial institutions raising the volume of transactions through it,” the statement said.NBC’s announcement was made at a time when commercial banks are having self-set exchange rates for use.For example, the KHR/USD exchange rate of ACLEDA Bank Plc was KHR 4,108 yesterday, while the official exchange rate of NBC was KHR 4,103.Meanwhile, the exchange rate of the General Department of Taxation, which sets its official exchange rate daily, was KHR 4,108 against $1 yesterday.Bun Neary, Deputy Director General of the GDT, said the official exchange rate would be helpful for some taxpayers who use dollars for payment.“This official exchange rate we set daily is based on the rates of four major commercial banks and it is a measure to help our taxpayers who use dollars,” Neary said in a press meet at the Government Spokesman Unit.According to the provisions in the Organization and Conduct of the NBC in Article 31, the central bank regularises the domestic exchange rate and is authorised to declare the official foreign exchange rates for the riel to other currencies and is to participate in international financial agreements on behalf of the government.The introduction of the official exchange rate is to ensure an accurate billing verification mechanism, particularly it facilitates online claiming of refunds and use of value-added tax credit efficiently, said Kong Vibol, director-general of the GDT.\n",

      "August 8, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501127587/usaid-to-launch-25-million-food-security-project-in-cambodia-this-week/\n",
      "The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will launch ‘Feed the Future Cambodia Harvest III’, a new $25 million project this week to promote food security and economic growth in Cambodia’s agriculture sector over the next five years, US senior officials said.US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that Harvest III will be implemented with more farmers, especially women and young people in all provinces nationwide and add grains, fish and other products to fruits, vegetables and spices to help farmers boost their incomes.“It will continue to help farmers boost their income, for example, by increasing access to tools like greenhouses, which can help lengthen growing seasons, improve the quality of what’s grown, and help products actually meet market standards,” Blinken said, adding that more than 60 percent of Cambodians live in rural areas.He went on to add that Cambodia and the US have worked together to increase crop yields, improve the health of livestock, promote climate resilience, train farmers and create markets but more than three-quarters of those Cambodian rural households rely on agriculture, fisheries or forestry as their main source of income and many of them have only limited access to markets or financing.“And we’ll help connect more Cambodian farmers and businesses to market both here at home and abroad. We want to change that so that more people can enjoy Cambodian products and more farmers and entrepreneurs can grow their businesses,” Blinken said.It is also a security issue because widespread hunger makes communities and countries less secure, particularly when food security around the world is on the rise because of Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine, which has blocked millions of tonnes of Ukrainian crops from being shipped to global markets.Over the five-year duration of the project, USAID anticipates generating $38 million in new private sector investments, creating more than 3,000 new jobs, helping Cambodian agriculture businesses and producers access $15 million in financing, and generating $100 million in sales, according to a statement released by the US Embassy in Cambodia.The statement pointed out that Harvest III will work with Cambodian agriculture cooperatives, technology providers, financial institutions, and other private sector stakeholders to develop a skilled workforce, create jobs, and capture market opportunities for farmers.The project will build on investments that USAID Cambodia has made over the past decade, promoting sustainable economic opportunities, introducing climate-smart agriculture technologies, and improving livelihoods for Cambodians, especially women, youth, and marginalized populations.US Ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy said the agriculture sector accounts for more than 20 percent of Cambodia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employs over 3 million Cambodians directly, and has been an incredible source of resilience during the pandemic during which agriculture absorbed many people who lost jobs, particularly in the tourism sector.USAID and the US Department of Agriculture have programs in food security and, more broadly agriculture, which have been critical to this resilience and in helping the sector’s economic potential.“As ambassador, I am charged with doing what I can to strengthen the relations between our two countries, and that means getting to meet lots of farmers and helping them expand trade between our two countries and bring technology, which really helps in this country with efficiencies and adding value to their products, and achieving more sustainable development,” Ambassador Murphy said.About 12 years ago, the United States launched an initiative called Cambodia Harvest, and that was part of our flagship global food security program called Feed the Future. The idea behind Feed the Future is that when it comes to chronic food insecurity, food aid is vital but it is not enough. \n",

The life insurance penetration rate is up to 1.1 percent, and the insurance density is only $18 per capita, which is far lower than the level of other countries in Southeast Asia. He said the core of life insurance is people-oriented, and health and wealth are very indispensable for the people. While explaining the mission of the company, he said, “The core business of our company is product and service.”Huione Life Insurance has also formed  a strategic partnership with Panda Commercial Bank.“I am glad that we have established a strategic partnership with Panda Commercial Bank Plc. I think the premise of cooperation is that the core business of both companies should match each other. We have a high tacit understanding with Panda Commercial Bank in the concept of digitalization and innovation. We will also provide full support to all the marketing activities of Panda Commercial Bank. “Ms. Liaw has more than 30 years of financial experience in Singapore and I have financial experience from China,” he said.The company is also focusing attention on digitalization.Another important focus of the company would be on humanistic care. “I require our team to think about what customers want and what their concerns are.”“I often talk in a humorous way that each insurance policy is like a “marriage license” for us and our customers, and that we have a responsibility on our “other half.”“I hope that health-related life insurance products of Huione Life can penetrate and comprehensively improve the health awareness of people. \n",

      "Xinhua – Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the China-ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting here on Thursday, during which the Chinese and ASEAN sides spoke highly of the achievements in their cooperation and pledged to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.The meeting, co-chaired by Wang and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, was attended by the foreign ministers of 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Lim Jock Hoi.Wang said that since Chinese President Xi Jinping and leaders of the ASEAN countries jointly announced the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership in November last year, the development of the partnership has got off to a good start with promising results yielded in various fields.The two sides have worked together to meet the challenges from various spillovers, and jointly maintained the hard-won peace and stability in the region, safeguarding “an oasis of peace,” he said.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, both sides showed solidarity in fighting the disease and strengthened cooperation in emergency management so as to build “a shield of safety,” said Wang.Both sides also jointly implemented the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and accelerated connectivity, creating “a highland for development,” he said.In addition, the two sides have strengthened cooperation to boost green development, address climate change, enhance ecological environmental protection, and promote energy transformation, while cementing public support by increasing direct flights, helping students from ASEAN countries to return to study in China in an orderly manner, and strengthening exchanges and cooperation in culture, tourism, think tanks and sports, he said.Wang said that China is willing to work with ASEAN to continue advancing the building of a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, to implement the important consensuses reached by the leaders of the two sides, to continue deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership, and to build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future, so as to make greater contributions to regional peace and development.Wang put forward a four-point proposal in this regard.First, the two sides should build a model of common development. Both sides should strengthen the synergy between their development strategies to achieve a higher level of mutual benefit.China is stepping up efforts to honour its commitment to providing assistance to ASEAN countries for their development, and facilitate the implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) in ASEAN countries, Wang said.He noted that both sides should jointly address pressing challenges such as public health, food and energy.Second, the two sides should set an example of connectivity. Wang said both sides should join hands to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, welcome more countries to participate in the construction of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and ensure the safety and smooth flow of industrial and supply chains.He said the two sides should work together to push for high-quality RCEP implementation, accelerate the follow-up negotiations on the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and expand cooperation in digital and green economy.Third, the two sides should strengthen coordination on global governance. Wang said the two sides should uphold open regionalism, promote true multilateralism, expand and strengthen the ASEAN-led regional structure, and jointly safeguard the interests of developing countries, so as to make “Asian contributions” to global governance.China appreciates that the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) adheres to independence, openness and inclusiveness, and focuses on development and cooperation, Wang said, adding China is willing to work with ASEAN countries to jointly enhance the synergy between the outlook and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as between that and the GDI.Fourth, the two sides should jointly maintain regional peace and stability. Noting that the Global Security Initiative (GSI) shares the security philosophy advocated by ASEAN, Wang said China is ready to work with ASEAN to explore the implementation of the initiative in ASEAN countries.He said both sides should speed up their consultation on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC),and hold the key to the issue in the hands of regional countries, so as to turn the South China Sea into a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship. Wang proposed the establishment of a China-ASEAN year of cooperation on agricultural development and food security, as well as the issuance of a joint statement on food security cooperation at the China-ASEAN leaders’ meeting.The Chinese side also circulated a document on China’s support for ASEAN’s central position, a list of supporting cooperation in the four priority areas of the AOIP, a progress report on building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, and a fact list on building a China-ASEAN blue economy partnership, among others.The foreign ministers attending the meeting spoke highly of the dynamic ASEAN-China cooperation with rich substance and remarkable achievements since the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two sides, appreciated China’s consistent support for ASEAN’s central position, and thanked China for providing vaccines to ASEAN countries in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Viewing China as a partner with mutual benefit and a shared vision, ASEAN countries said they fully endorse President Xi’s proposal to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, and look forward to the synergy of the BRI and the AOIP, and to further exploring the implementation of the GDI and the GSI in ASEAN.The foreign ministers expressed satisfaction with the progress made in RCEP implementation and appreciated China for taking the lead in reaching a free trade agreement with ASEAN.They said they look forward to accelerating follow-up negotiations on upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, and pushing for substantive progress in the consultation of the COC to jointly safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity.During the meeting, Wang further expounded on China’s solemn stance on the provocation by the US side to infringe on China’s sovereignty.All parties at the meeting said they adhere to the one-China policy and support China in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity.The ASEAN foreign ministers also issued a statement on the cross-Strait situation, reiterating their countries’ firm adherence to the one-China principle.The meeting also approved an action plan for the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership, which will be submitted to the China-ASEAN leaders’ meeting for endorsement.\n",

      "AFP – Millions of boxes of oranges are spoiling in containers stranded at European ports as South Africa and the European Union lock horns in a dispute over import rules, citrus growers have said.South Africa, the world’s second-largest exporter of fresh citrus after Spain, filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) last month after the EU introduced new plant and health safety requirements that orange farmers say threaten their survival.The measures came into force in July as ships were already at sea carrying hundreds of containers full of South African fruit to Europe, resulting in them being held up on arrival, South Africa’s Citrus Growers’ Association (CGA) says.“It’s a complete and utter disaster,” CGA’s CEO Justin Chadwick told AFP by phone.“Food that has fantastic quality and is safe is (just) sitting there – and this at a time when people are worried about food security.”The EU rules aim at tackling the potential spread of an insect called the false codling moth, a pest native to sub-Saharan Africa that feeds on fruits including oranges and grapefruits.The new measures require South African farmers to apply extreme cold treatment to all Europe-bound oranges and keep the fruits at temperatures of two degrees Celsius (35 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower for 25 days.But the CGA says this measure is unnecessary as the country already has its own, more targeted way of preventing infestation.In its WTO complaint, South Africa argued that the EU requirements were “not based on science”, more restrictive than necessary and “discriminatory”.South African citrus growers say the requirement puts undue extra pressure on an industry already in dire straits.“This is going to add a lot of costs… and at the moment, that is what no grower in the world can afford,” said Hannes de Waal, who heads of the almost 100-year-old farm Sundays River Citrus.De Waal, whose company has orange, clementine and lemon trees straddling 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) near the southeastern coast city of Gqeberha, said revenues were already squeezed by high shipping and fertiliser costs.Freight costs have rocketed since Covid-19 struck, and so has the price of fertilisers due to the war in Ukraine – Russia being one of the world’s largest producers.‘Under pressure’Europe is the largest market for South Africa’s almost $2 billion citrus industry, accounting for 37 percent of all exports, according to the CGA.The new rules hit at the height of South Africa’s orange season, during the southern hemisphere’s winter, when export operations were in full swing.This gave fruit growers too little time to adapt, said Chadwick.Some 3.2 million cartons of citrus worth about 605 million rand ($36 million) left port with paperwork that would be wrong on arrival.The South African government was scrambling to issue new documents for shipments that met the new criteria, but hundreds of containers could be slated for destruction, said Chadwick.South Africa already has an effective anti-moth system, the CGA says.“Our system does involve cold treatment, but targeted at the risk, whereas the EU measure is a blanket measure that covers all oranges,” Chadwick said.“The higher the risk, the more extreme the cold treatment,” he said, of the South African measures.The dispute is now with the WTO. The parties have 60 days to negotiate a solution. Failing that, the complainant can request the matter be decided by a panel of experts.The EU said it was confident of the “WTO-compatibility” of its measures.“The objective of the EU’s plant and health safety criteria is to protect the union territory from the potential significant impact on the agriculture and the environment, should this pest establish itself in the union,” a spokesperson for the EU Commission said in a statement.Chadwick hopes that “sense” will prevail and a quick fix can be found.“Our industry is under pressure. It’s basically a year of survival,” he said.\n",

      "AFP – Syria’s internal commerce ministry has announced a petrol price hike of around 130 percent in the war-torn country facing fuel shortages and extended power cuts.The cost of a litre of subsidised fuel will rise to 2,500 Syrian pounds, from 1,100 previously, a rise of 127 percent, the ministry said in a statement quoted by the official SANA news agency late Saturday.The cost of non-subsidised petrol will rise from 3,500 to 4,000 Syrian pounds, the ministry added.The increases represent the third time this year that authorities have increased the price of fuel, as the Syrian pound continues to depreciate. Syria’s currency is trading at around 4,250 to the dollar on the black market, compared to an official rate of 2,814.“This measure will hit everyone,” said Raed al-Saadi, a worker. “Our salary is now only enough to get us to the workplace, and not even enough to get us home again.”“Life has become very difficult and I don’t where this situation will lead us,” the 48-year-old added.Since the outbreak of war in 2011, Syria’s oil and gas sector has suffered losses amounting to tens of billions of dollars.The economy has been hit hard by both the long-running war and sanctions imposed against Damascus.A UN commission in March called for a review of sanctions against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime because of concerns that the measures were hitting ordinary people too hard.The conflict in Syria started in 2011 with the brutal repression of peaceful protests and escalated to pull in foreign powers and jihadists. It has killed 500,000 people and displaced half of the country’s population.\n",

And we’re also busy concreting the pavement of the airfield area. We’re determined to finish the whole project in three years as planned.”The project kicked off in March 2020, when the COVID outbreak had just started.

We’ve asked our staff to get vaccinated and quarantine when necessary, and we’ve also been monitoring everyone’s body temperature.”The project involves more than 1,000 local workers. The airport is scheduled to be completed in March next year and become operational in October.TEKRETH SAMRACH Chairman, Steering Committee for Construction of Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport “The airport itself will promote trade, investment, tourist arrival, air transportation services. This will lead to economic growth and job creation for Cambodian people. Tourist industry plays a very important role in Cambodian economy. It takes up like 15 to 17% of our GDP. This is going to be the biggest airport in Cambodia.”And bilateral cooperation goes far beyond infrastructure.

      "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement would be a key contributor to the recovery strategy of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to an ASEAN foreign ministers’ joint communique released here on Friday.In the joint communique issued after the 55th ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting (55th AMM) held in Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia, the ministers welcomed the entry into force of the RCEP from Jan 1, 2022.“The RCEP would make significant contribution to our recovery strategy and continue to support an inclusive and open trade and investment architecture in the region,” the communique said.The ministers also welcomed the outcomes of the first RCEP Joint Committee (RJC) Meeting in April, which discussed the preparation of RCEP implementation, including the establishment of the committees to monitor RCEP implementation and the endorsement of the key elements on the establishment of the RCEP secretariat.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 55th AMM on Wednesday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen proposed the establishment of a standalone secretariat in Cambodia to maximize the potential of the RCEP.“Cambodia is ready to host this RCEP secretariat. We have even thought of where in Phnom Penh the secretariat should be located, while we are working to formulate our detailed proposal,” he said.“I hope Cambodia can win the support of fellow ASEAN member states, as well as all RCEP participating countries when we submit our proposal officially.”The RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.The mega-regional pact will eliminate as much as 90 percent of the tariffs on goods traded among its signatories over the next 20 years.Being the world’s largest trade bloc, the RCEP established a market of 2.2 billion people, or 30 percent of the world population with a combined Gross Domestic Product of $26.2 trillion, which represents around 30 percent of global GDP and 28 percent of global trade.According to an Asian Development Bank’s study, the RCEP will increase the member economies’ incomes by 0.6 percent by 2030, adding $245 billion annually to regional income and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment. China DailyCambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman Penn Sovicheat said the RCEP would inject a new impetus into regional and global economic growth in the long term.“The RCEP will give a big boost to our economy in the post-pandemic era,” he told Xinhua. “It is also a well-timed intervention in Cambodia’s quest for a Least Developed Country (LDC) graduation, likely by 2028 and the country’s planned endeavor to achieve the upper-middle income and high-income statuses by 2030 and 2050, respectively.”Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute of the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said the RCEP is instrumental in subverting creeping unilateralism because it pulls all bilateral free trade agreements into one economic sphere, under one blanket trade ruling.“It is the most ambitious regional free trade agreement in Asia in which China has played a vital role in converting Asian economy into a core economic polar aimed at averting protectionism and the widespread negative impacts of the trade war,” he told Xinhua.\n",

The UK’s Dialogue Partner status, the first ASEAN has agreed to in 25 years, was formalised in August 2021 and an important part to the UK’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific.Closer ties with the Southeast Asia bloc will help create green jobs, reinforce our security cooperation, promote tech and science partnerships, and safeguard key pillars of international law like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The Minister also announced that InfraCo Asia, which the UK supports through its funding to the Private Infrastructure Development Group, is providing a $2.3 million loan to support the development of Cambodia’s water supply network.During the meeting, Minister Milling made clear that Russia’s unprovoked, premeditated and barbaric attack against the sovereign democratic state of Ukraine remains in the hearts of the British people and the UK stands united with international partners in condemning the Russian government’s reprehensible actions.On Myanmar, Minister Milling strongly condemned the recent appalling and barbaric executions of pro-democracy activists by the Myanmar junta. She reiterated the UK continues to support ASEAN’s Five Point Consensus on Myanmar and the urgent need for an immediate end to the violence and for a peaceful solution to the crisis.Since becoming Dialogue Partner, the UK invited ASEAN to be represented at the G7 Foreign Ministers last December and during the global Covid-19 pandemic, donated 4.3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to ASEAN members and contributed £1m to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund.The UK also recently signed an MoU with the Asian Development Bank to support ASEAN states to invest in green infrastructure through a £107m trust fund to support the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility.

      "Cambodia’s famed Angkor Archeological Park attracted 83,854 foreign tourists in the first seven months of 2022, up 13.5 times compared to the same period last year, said a press statement on Thursday.The ancient site made $3.37 million in revenue from ticket sales during the January-July period this year, also up 13 folds year-on-year, said the state-owned Angkor Enterprise’s statement.In July alone, the Angkor welcomed 23,871 foreigners, up 52 times compared to the same month last year, it said.Located in the northwest Siem Reap province, the 401-square-km Angkor Archeological Park, inscribed on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1992, is the most popular tourist destination in the Southeast Asian country.Tourism Minister Thong Khon said on Monday that foreigners, who come to live and work in Cambodia for two years or longer, will be allowed to visit the Angkor free of charge, saying that the move was to encourage more tourists to the site.He said foreign tourists buying a one-day entrance ticket can visit Angkor for two days, while the three-day pass will be increased to five days of visit and the seven-day pass to 10 days of visit.The entrance fee for a one-day visit to the site is 37 dollars, a three-day visit costs 62 dollars, and a week-long visit costs 72 dollars.Long Kosal, deputy director-general of the Apsara National Authority, said Angkor is predicted to attract more tourists in the coming months and years as the Covid-19 pandemic has waned.“As our country has reopened its borders to all travellers without quarantine, I believe that more international tourists will spend their holidays at Angkor in the near future,” he told Xinhua.During the pre-pandemic era, Angkor received up to 2.2 million international visitors in 2019, generating 99 million dollars in revenue from ticket sales, according to the Angkor Enterprise.

      "A Chinese-aided study on the intermodal transport master plan has been completed and the report was handed to the Cambodian government as the Kingdom prepares the comprehensive Intermodal Transport master plan for 2022-2030.The report was presented in a ceremony on Wednesday in the presence of Ros Seilava, member of the Supreme National Economic Council, representatives of the Chinese company, Chinese Embassy in Cambodia and partner organizations.Under a grant from the Chinese government, the study was initiated by the Supreme National Economic Council in collaboration with the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC), development partners and the private sector.The report will be used in compiling the comprehensive master plan on intermodal transport in Cambodia, said Seilava.“The Supreme National Economic Council, together with the National Council of Logistics and the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, will combine the report when drafting the master plan on connectivity and logistics and other reports of studies by institutions and other development partners aimed at building a ‘Comprehensive Intermodal Transport Master Plan for Cambodia 2022-2030’,” Seilava said.Cambodia is developing a comprehensive master plan for an intermodal transportation system to better develop Cambodia’s transport sector for connectivity with countries in the region and the world.The China-backed study will contribute to the logistics and transportation enhancement in Cambodia, said Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.“The study report from the Chinese side is to help fill the gaps in the logistics of Cambodia to improve transport and reduce costs, which is important as now shipping cost in Cambodia is still higher compared to other Asean countries,” Heng said.The Ministry of Public Works and Transport is currently drafting the master plan for the connection of multimodal transport and logistics.The efforts of the ministry in cooperation with YCH on the Phnom Penh logistics centre development study project, the Sihanoukville logistics center development study project, the Tonle Bassac navigation development study project, the high-speed rail modernization study project, the Phnom Penh-Bavet expressway project, and construction of the Kampong Thom-Kampong Chhnang, Battambang-Siem Reap Expressway are parts of the effective logistics system. \n",

      "Jiangsu General Science Technology Co Ltd, a Chinese listed tyre company, established a wholly-owned subsidiary General Intelligence (Cambodia) Co Ltd in the Kingdom to produce five million semi-steel radial tyres and 900,000 steel-belted radial tyres annually at Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) with an investment of $300 million.An official of General Intelligence told Khmer Times that Cambodia has a favourable investment environment, including a stable domestic political environment, steady economic growth, and preferential tax policies of the government.“It can make better use of local rubber resources and human resources to establish production bases in Cambodia,” the official said.“The location of this project is at an international industrial park in Cambodia. It is close to the airport, port and highway, and has good geological advantages,” he said, adding that this is the first tyre factory in SSEZ.The brand of tyres produced is mainly ‘CELIMO’, a high-end tyre brand. The tyres will be sold to the United States, Brazil, Southeast Asia and other countries.It is expected that more than 1,600 jobs will be added. After the operation and development of the company, it will fully promote the local economic development and stimulate domestic demand.Jiangsu General Science Technology is actively deploying overseas production bases for the demands of international development.As early as 2018, before the company set up a production base in Thailand, it planned to invest and build a factory in Cambodia and carried out a lot of preliminary research and field visits.Jiangsu General Science Technology Co has restarted the project construction on nearly 180,000 square metres of the total planned land area of the factory and over 200,000 square metres of the total construction area in Cambodia.Chhin Chien Kang, chairman of the Board of Directors of Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, said that from January to June 2022, the value of exports and imports at the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone reached $1.3 billion, an increase of 38 percent compared to the previous year.Following the global epidemic of Covid-19, the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone has strived to secure production lines and has attracted a total of 170 enterprises from Europe, the United States, China and Southeast Asia, and created nearly 30,000 jobs.SSEZ—jointly developed and constructed by private companies from both Cambodia and China—will form an ecological model park with supporting functions for 300 enterprises for employment of 80,000 to 100,000 industrial workers. \n",

      "The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications plans to connect 2,715 kilometres of submarine fibre optic cable network from Hong Kong to Preah Sihanouk, Chea Vandeth, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, said yesterday.The project, which will be launched this year, is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, the minister said in a press conference at the office of the Council of Ministers.He said that after the completion of this network connection, the internet capacity in the country will be wider than before, and the users would not have to worry about a weak internet connection. Besides, the country will also have access to cheaper internet services.“We have about 640 kilometres of submarine cable network and we are considering 2,700 kilometres from Hong Kong,” Vandeth said.He also pointed out that the country has around 17.8 million internet subscribers, exceeding the country’s total population of 16 million because many people have subscribed to more than one internet service.The minister said about 17.48 million have subscribed to the mobile internet service and 312,233 to the fixed internet service.“The high number of internet users has importantly contributed to the development of e-commerce in Cambodia,” he said.Vandeth said e-commerce has seen rapid development in recent years and that the market value of e-commerce in Cambodia was $970 million in 2021 and is projected to rise to $1.1 billion in 2022.“E-commerce market value is predicted to reach $1.78 billion in 2025,” he said.Cambodia currently has five mobile phone operators and 38 internet service providers, the minister said.Around 13.2 million people in the country use Facebook while there have been 2 million users on Instagram.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125998/southeast-asia-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-5-in-2022/\n",
      "The Asian Development Bank revised its GDP growth projections for Southeast Asian countries in 2022 to 5 percent, slightly up from its earlier estimates of 4.9 percent.The bank, which maintained the forecast for 2023 at 5.2 percent, made its observations regarding the economic performance of Asean Countries in its Asian Development Outlook Supplement for July.The bank also significantly raised Southeast Asia’s inflation forecast for 2022 from 3.7 percent to 4.7 percent. Inflation next year is revised up, from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent.It said consumption growth in all subregional economies rebounded strongly in the first five months of this year due to the gradual lifting of Covid-19 mobility restrictions and the reopening of markets and borders.The bank observed that the manufacturing and services output has been increasing in most economies, helping create jobs and lifting household incomes.However, it warned that the countries in the region face some significant challenges, including higher oil prices, the end of low global interest rates, and trade and supply disruptions.It said such factors have dimmed the outlook for some economies\n",
      "in 2022 and 2023.“Smaller economies in particular are being more heavily affected by supply disruptions and inflation from higher oil prices. Tourist arrivals are picking up, albeit very slowly,” the report mentioned.It also pointed out that the economies in the subregion with high vaccination rates have yet to see meaningful tourism revivals.It raised the growth projection for Indonesia from 5 percent to 5.2 percent due to the robust domestic demand and exports.The bank said increased uncertainty and weaker global growth have been dampening Malaysia’s prospects.“Growth of five percent in Q1 2022 was underpinned by strong private consumption and increased government assistance through the Bantuan Keluarga family assistance programme. But business confidence and the PMI continue to soften in step with weaker global prospects and supply disruptions from cities in the PRC that were locked down to tackle Covid-19 outbreaks,” the report said.The bank also raised the growth forecast for the Philippines from 6 percent to 6.5 percent for 2022 on a stronger-than-expected first quarter performance, underpinned by rebounds in investment and household consumption.“Wider Covid-19 vaccination coverage and relatively mild health impacts from the Omicron variant allowed the economy to reopen further,” it added.According to the report, Singapore’s growth will remain firm in 2022, supported by robust information technology and financial services, sustained manufacturing growth, and a gradual recovery in tourism and domestic-oriented services sectors.The bank also maintained a growth forecast of 6.5 percent for this year and 6.7 percent for next year for Viet Nam.It said the Lao PDR’s economic prospects in 2022 are looking dimmer because of declining consumer and business confidence caused by rising prices and a weaker local currency. However, the outlook is expected to improve in 2023. “While there are slight improvements in industry and services growth in Myanmar, political tensions and a volatile security situation remain the major downside risks to economic recovery,” the report pointed out. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125999/over-emphasis-on-digitalisation-hurt-msmes-during-covid-19/\n",
      "Some of the main mistakes the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Southeast Asia made during the Covid-19 pandemic period include over-emphasis on digitalisation, informal operations, spiralling costs, and failure to avail of government schemes, a report said.Many MSMEs went digital to overcome the crisis and many of them proved successful during the Covid-19 crisis.“It improved access to business information, strengthened business networks, created business opportunities (including access to global marketplaces and global supply chains), and reduced administrative costs,” according to a new Asian Development Bank (ADB) report based on surveys.According to the report, digitalisation did not ensure profitability.In Indonesia, the share of those with a more than six percent income increase was likely higher in digitally operated MSMEs than non-digital MSMEs in August–September 2020, the report pointed out. They were mainly small firms selling essential daily goods, food, and health-care products and delivering them. However, toward 2021, the share of those with no revenue or more than a 30 percent decrease in income likely increased among digitally operated MSMEs than non-digital MSMEs. Some of the reasons cited were limited demand for nonessential goods and services during social restrictions, weak business models and starting the enterprise without a business strategy, unfamiliarity with using technology for operations, and poor cost management during digitalisation, the report mentioned.Another mistake made by MSMEs was their informal operations. By not registering a business, they failed to secure access to bank credit because of the requirement of formal documentation to secure a loan. The informal lines of credit have higher interest rates, putting many of them at debt risk.“The MSMEs surveyed continued to struggle to reduce costs a year into the pandemic,” the report said.“The debt burden is quite heavy on them and the servicing needs that arise from these debts obviously pose an enormous burden on the enterprises,” Ramesh Subramaniam, director general of ADB’s Southeast Asia Department, was quoted as saying in the report.The results suggest that better cost management is needed for MSMEs to survive, given the protracted pandemic and outbreaks of new Covid-19 variants.The survey also indicated the lack of information on several government programmes. \n",

      "The intergovernmental Mekong Institute (MI) which works on socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) was on Wednesday awarded the Asean Prize 2021 at the 55th Asean Ministerial Meeting hosted by Cambodia in Phnom Penh, senior officials said.MI was founded and represented by Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam to support international, regional cooperation and economic integration through agriculture development and commercialization, trade and investment facilitation and sustainable energy and environment, while addressing issues of social inclusion and vulnerability, digital economy and innovation, and labour mobility.Suriyan Vichitlekarn, executive director of Thailand-based MI received the award from Cambodia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He told Khmer Times that the institute works on the four areas of specialisation through developing the capacity of government officials and institutions in the region.MI is promoting logistics, infrastructure development, e-commerce, small and medium enterprise development, food safety, quality, standard, cross-border value chain, sustainable and green energy, environmental responsibility in terms of green and resilient economy and labour mobility, according to Vichitlekarn.“It also means that Asean recognises the growing importance of Mekong countries and what we have done to the countries also contributes to the strengths and achievements of Asean. So, we will continue to do it better to reduce the development gap so that these countries can be very close to other Asean countries,” he said.He added that to achieve international recognition with the Asean Prize, firstly MI has developed the capacity of about 7,500 alumni in the region who gradually become policymakers and contribute to the regional cooperation and secondly, it created a platform for the government, private sector, civil society and academic institutions to work together and thirdly conduct research on policy implementation issues.“So, we have become a true partner. I think this is something that the prize may imply to all the people that Mekong countries are not only members but also we are important members and we will use the opportunity of being the winner to advocate the importance of the development of the region,” he said.Vichitlekarn explained that MI will not only find ways to approach donors and development partners to provide stronger support, as Mekong countries will become stronger as it forms  half of Asean and also connects to other Asean countries on mainland Asia to share its experience among Mekong and Asean countries.Chea Chantum, Secretary General of General Secretariat for Population and Development of the Ministry of Planning, told Khmer Times that about 1,300 officials who are working in Cambodia including himself and his colleagues are among the 7,500 alumni of MI and he attended a three-week training at the institute in 1998.“The prize is evidence that our government contributes to the institute and what it has been doing is on the right track. Personally, I am proud of the prize and I think the government will also be proud of this as well,” Chantum said.Hang Suviddya, Deputy Secretary General of General Secretariat for Population and Development of the Ministry of Planning, said that the award may inspire non-governmental organizations in Cambodia to work harder to the next level if they want to be recognised with such awards.“When I have an opportunity, I will tell them that the institute is a symbol,” said Suviddya, who is an alumni and attended a one-month training on economic integration at MI.Pornwilai Anne Pumira, Partnership and Resource Mobilization at MI, said the Ministry of Planning in Cambodia is also working with the institution and helping the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in organizing the 55th Asean Ministerial Meeting and related meetings hosted by Cambodia in Phnom Penh. \n",

      "Frankfurt (AFP) – German industrial orders dipped in June, official figures published Thursday showed, as Europe’s largest economy faced the threat of a recession in the months to come.New orders — which usually provide a foretaste of industrial output — fell by 0.4 percent in June from the previous month, the federal statistics agency Destatis calculated.The previous month’s reading was revised to show a drop of 0.2 percent, having previously shown a small improvement.The switch meant Germany had now seen industrial orders drop for five consecutive months.The overall drop was “mostly due” to a 4.3 percent decline in the volume of orders from outside the eurozone, Destatis said.Meanwhile, orders from within the eurozone and Germany rose by 3.4 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.Orders for capital goods used in production fell by 1.8 percent, while those of intermediate and consumer goods rose by 1.2 and 1.7 percent.The downwards turn in many economic indicators has led analysts to warn of a downturn in Germany.Increasing pessimism among businesses suggested Germany was “on the cusp of a recession”, said Ifo Institute president Clemens Fuest.The German economy stagnated between April and June, registering a growth of zero percent, according to official figures published last week. \n",

      "Beijing (AFP) – Chinese military exercises around Taiwan are set to disrupt one of the world’s busiest shipping zones, analysts told AFP, highlighting the island’s critical position in already stretched global supply chains.The drills – China’s largest-ever around Taiwan – are a major show of strength after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi infuriated Beijing by visiting the island.The manoeuvres kicked off Thursday and will take place along some of the busiest shipping routes on the planet, used to supply vital semiconductors and electronic equipment produced in East Asian factory hubs to global markets.The routes are also a key artery for natural gas.Nearly half the world’s container ships passed through the narrow Taiwan Strait – which separates the island from the Chinese mainland – in the first seven months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Given that much of the world’s container fleet passes through that waterway, there will inevitably be disruptions to global supply chains due to the rerouting,” said James Char, an associate research fellow at Singapore’s\n",
      "S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.‘Incredibly busy waterway’ Even a small disruption in global supply chains, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, could prove costly.“China’s planned live-fire exercises are occurring in an incredibly busy waterway,” Nick Marro, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s lead analyst for global trade, wrote in a note.“The shutting down of these transport routes – even temporarily – has consequences not only for Taiwan, but also trade flows tied to Japan and South Korea.”The uncertainty dragged the Taiwan Taiex Shipping and Transportation Index, which\n",
      "tracks major shipping and airline stocks, down 1.05 percent on Thursday.The index was down 4.6 percent since the beginning of the week.Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau has warned ships in northern, eastern and southern areas to avoid the areas being used for the drills.But several shipping companies contacted by AFP said they were waiting to see the impact of the drills before rerouting.The ongoing typhoon season made it riskier to divert ships around the eastern coast of Taiwan through the Philippine Sea, some added.Others said they would stick to their schedules.“We don’t see any impact during (this) period and we don’t have any plan on re-routing our vessels,” said Bonnie Huang, a spokesman for Maersk China.The drills have also hit air routes.Over the last two days, more than 400 flights were cancelled at major airports in Fujian, the Chinese province closest to Taiwan, signalling that the airspace could be used by the military.Taiwan’s cabinet meanwhile, has said the exercises would disrupt 18 international routes passing through its flight information region (FIR).Aggressive posturingDuring the previous Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s, China conducted military exercises for months, including lobbing missiles into waters off Taiwan and rehearsing amphibious assaults on the island.“The Chinese undoubtedly wanted to demonstrate resolve in ways that went beyond what they did in 1996,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at the US-based German Marshall Fund think tank.China’s Global Times newspaper said Wednesday the drills were aimed at showing that China’s military is “capable of blockading the entire island”.But China’s ongoing economic woes mean it is unlikely to risk a major disruption and would limit itself to aggressive posturing, analysts said.“Closing off traffic through the Strait for any extended period of time will also hurt the Chinese economy,” Char said.“It’s not in Beijing’s interest to interrupt civilian travel and trade in the region,” said Natasha Kassam of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.The extent to which China will escalate its response to the Pelosi visit – flexing its military muscle, cyber-attacks and economic sanctions – remains to be seen.Given its military advances, “China very likely has the ability to enforce an air and maritime blockade against Taiwan,” said Thomas Shugart, an expert at US think tank the Center for a New American Security.“Whether China will choose to attempt such a blockade… is largely a matter of how much political and economic risk the Chinese Communist Party’s leaders are willing to incur.”\n",

      "About 92 per cent of the households receiving money under the Covid-19 Cash Transfer Programme in Cambodia spent it on food, found a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study jointly undertaken with the General Secretariat for the National Social Protection Council, recently, indicating that the scheme, running for over two years, substantially contributed to addressing poverty during the pandemic.Meanwhile, considering the continued impact of the pandemic on vulnerable households, the government is planning to extend the programme, launched on June 24, 2020 by Prime Minister Hun Sen, beyond 2022.As per the earlier plan, the programme, implemented with the support UNDP, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, was to end next month.The programme has supported nearly 70,000 households who are among the poorest and the most vulnerable, the impact assessment study undertaken with a sample size of 1,000 beneficiaries said. The government dishes out an average of around $35 million a month for the programme.The macroeconomic modelling of the study also suggested that the programme helped to stimulate GDP growth by 0.55 percent in 2020 and 0.45 percent in 2021, reduce poverty rate by 2.7 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2021, and reduce unemployment rate by 0.57 percent in 2020 and 0.62 percent in 2021.The study found that on an average a household received about $50 a month under the programme and spent around $37 on food, meaning 92 of them spent up to three-quarters of the cash they received only on food. The remaining spent money on medicine, utility payments, education, clothing, savings, social or religious event etc. in that order.As many as 99 percent of the recipients were satisfied with the current cash transfer mechanism, and when asked for their preference, around 92 percent chose cash over other support.More than 75 percent of the respondents also reported that women are the main decision-makers on household expenses. It was also found that the cash transfer scheme beneficiaries are less likely to take additional loans or drop out of schools.The study also recommended that financial literacy needs to be raised among the cash recipients, particularly when it comes to the relationship with financial service providers. It further suggested that the government continue the programme during the Covid-19 recovery period.UNDP officer-in-charge for Cambodia, Sonali Dayaratne, emphasized the importance of the evidence presented by the new report that investments in social protection can effectively support the most vulnerable. “The impacts the programme has had on their lives are essential building blocks for a more inclusive social protection system in Cambodia,” she said, according to a release.Phan Phalla, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, said the results of the study not only illustrate the effectiveness and transparency of the programme implementation but also crystalize the role of social assistance intervention in improving their livelihood and stimulating the economy.\n",

      "Beijing (AFP) – China rolled out curbs Wednesday on the import of fruit and fish from Taiwan while halting shipments of sand to the island in the wake of a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The trip by Pelosi, who is second in line to the presidency and the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, has ignited a diplomatic firestorm.She landed late Tuesday in the wake of increasingly stark warnings from China, which considers the island a part of its territory to one day be reclaimed, by force if necessary.China’s Customs Administration said Wednesday it would suspend some citrus fruit imports from Taiwan over alleged “repeated” detection of excessive pesticide residue, and the import of fish owing to positive coronavirus tests on packages.In a separate notice, the Commerce Ministry added it would also “suspend the export of natural sand to Taiwan” from Wednesday, without providing details.Natural sand is generally used for producing concrete and asphalt, and most of Taiwan’s imported sand and gravel comes from China.The moves are part of a “common pattern for Beijing”, said Even Pay, an agriculture analyst at consultancy Trivium China.More disruptions of agricultural and food trade can be expected in the coming days, she added.“When diplomatic or trade tensions are running high, Chinese regulators typically take an extremely strict approach to compliance… looking for any issues that can be used to justify a trade ban,” she told AFP.China is Taiwan’s biggest trading partner and export market, with bilateral trade growing 26 percent on-year to $328 billion in 2021, official data shows.It is not the first time Beijing has taken aim at the island’s exports.China banned pineapple imports in March 2021, citing the discovery of pests, in a move that was widely seen as politically driven.Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, as she views the island as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of “one China”.On top of the latest bans, Taipei’s Council of Agriculture said Tuesday that China had cited regulatory breaches in suspending the import of other Taiwanese goods, including fishery products, tea and honey.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities also announced planned live-fire military drills encircling Taiwan, in a move Taipei’s defence ministry said threatened key ports and urban areas.At some points, the zone of Chinese operations will come within 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) of Taiwan’s shoreline, according to coordinates shared by the People’s Liberation Army.Taiwan’s 23 million people have long lived with the possibility of an invasion, but that threat has intensified under President Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125234/bmw-profits-drop-as-china-lockdowns-knock-production/\n",
      "Frankfurt (AFP) – German auto manufacturer BMW said Wednesday its profits dipped in the second quarter as supply bottlenecks and Chinese lockdowns knocked production.The carmaker’s profits for the period between April and June fell to three billion euros ($3.1 billion) from 4.8 billion euros in the same period last year.BMW CEO Oliver Zipse recognised “unfavourable conditions” but said in a statement the Munich-based group had shown “a high degree of resilience”.“Ongoing semiconductor supply issues and supply chain disruptions following Covid lockdowns in China”, a key market for automakers, held back production in the first half of the year, BMW said in a statement.BMW shipped just over 563,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, a drop of 19.8 percent.Like other premium carmakers, the limits to production meant that BMW leant more heavily on its top-of-the-range models with bigger margins.The group benefited from this better “product mix” and higher prices for its vehicles, which partially offset the fall in the number of vehicles sold, BMW said.BMW said economic conditions would “remain difficult” in the second half of the year, with the war in Ukraine also disrupting supply and weighing on the industry.Unit sales in the second half would be “solidly higher”, BMW said, but would “not fully compensate for lost volume” in the first half, meaning deliveries of its vehicles would now be “slightly below” the level of last year.Stong demand and recent tight supply meant BMW had an “above-average order bank”.But high inflation on the back of soaring energy prices would cool the economy and see BMW’s order backlog “normalise towards the end of the year”.BMW’s predictions did not take into account the impact that a cut to Russian gas supplies to Europe could have on its production locally. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501125236/possible-for-us-eu-to-avoid-recession-fed-official-says/\n",
      "Washington (AFP) – The United States and the European Union can avoid recession and achieve a soft landing by bringing inflation down to an acceptable level, a US central bank official said Tuesday.“A soft landing is feasible in the US and the EA (euro area),” St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard during a speech at New York University.But getting there requires that the “shift” in monetary policy, as central banks aggressively hike interest rates to slow runaway inflation,  is “executed well.”A key factor will be managing inflation expectations, he added.If markets and consumers expect prices to continue to rise then they will act accordingly, with stores raising prices, people rushing to buy goods before prices go up, and employees demanding higher wages, among other things.“Current inflation in the US and the euro area is near 1970s levels,” Bullard said.The fight against inflation then was “costly” to the US economy, with multiple periods of recession, he said, attributing that to the Fed’s lack of “credibility.”“Few believed that the Fed was serious about reducing inflation after an entire decade of allowing inflation to build.”As a result, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker had to “earn credibility” through aggressive fiscal policy.But “the Fed and the ECB (European Central Bank) have considerable credibility compared with their 1970s counterparts,” Bullard said.He acknowledged that inflation had come in “hotter” than expected during the second quarter of 2022. As a result, the Fed will have to hike interest rates “a little bit higher” than Buller had initially projected.The Fed’s key rates, which set the tone for commercial banks in the United States, are currently between 2.25 and 2.50 percent.They will have to be raised to between 3.75 and four percent by the end of the year, Bullard said.US inflation hit 9.1 percent in June, the highest in four decades.Inflation also reached a new record in the eurozone in July, coming in at 8.9 percent. \n",

The forecast was made by observing a slowdown in the growth of oil-related commodity prices to 9.3 percent, as global crude oil prices are projected to decline from July to the end of 2022.Food prices are expected to drop to 2.5 percent, which is supported by an improvement in the supply chain as China eases restrictions.Dr Hong Vannak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said that falling oil and energy prices had pushed down commodity prices.

      "The Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is finalising procedures for the government bond issuance, expects to complete the initial public offering (IPO) within this year.The government has started to work on the issuance of bonds aimed to create a new source of public financing and a financial instrument for investors in the securities market and reduce dependence on foreign funds.Technical procedures of bond issuance are being finalised, said Meas Soksensan, General Secretariat and spokesperson at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, in a press conference at the Government’s Spokesman Unit yesterday.“The ministry has almost fully implemented and what remains is the technical team to conduct a survey and review before issue and securities transactions,” he said.The IPO of the government bond will be a major source of domestic capital for public investment projects and boost national economic growth, he said.“Government needs financing from abroad for public investment. The government bond issuance provides the possibility that domestic firms can buy the bond at a proper rate, rather than the country borrowing from development partners,” Soksensan said.The Cambodian government plans to issue bonds worth 1.2 trillion riels, equivalent to approximately $300 million.The government’s decision to issue government bonds is to develop and strengthen the capital sector of Cambodia, as well as to raise capital from the private sector as much as possible.The successful issuance of the securities will help the government to fund large infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways, and airports, said Hong Sok Hour, Chief Executive Officer of the Cambodia Securities Exchange.“The Cambodian government now has access to funds from overseas partners. If the foreign sources of capital dwindle as Cambodia develops, we need to have our own sources of capital. Therefore, the issuance of government securities is a step to secure the future,” he said recently.CSX has currently 16 listed securities – nine equity firms and seven corporate bonds, and the listed companies had cumulatively raised more than $280 million from the stock market.The daily trading value of CSX hit an average of $870,000 in the first semester this year.The CSX is a joint venture with the Cambodian government holding a 55 percent stake while the Korean Exchange owns the remaining. \n",

      "Cambodia’s economy is projected to grow by 5.4 percent, according to the mid-year assessment of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), but down from the previous forecast of 5.6 percent made at the beginning of the year, as the effects of Covid-19 have not fully mitigated.At a press conference yesterday, MEF spokesperson Meas Soksensan said, “The war between Russia and Ukraine is creating issues such as hight inflation due to the rising prices of oil and food items. The MEF will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation and put in place intervention measures in a timely manner.”Therefore, he said, the 2022 budget can still be considered as an effective policy tool of the government to maintain economic stability and people’s livelihood against the impact of Covid-19, besides giving a roadmap for economic recovery.At the same time, the budget underscores the government’s commitment to increasing the efficiency and level of revenue collection through the implementation of strict measures.Meanwhile, Soksensan highlighted that Cambodia’s public debt stands at $9.81 billion, with 68 percent of it coming from bilateral developing partners (DPs) and 32 percent from multilateral DPs.“Our total external debt stands between 33 percent and 35 percent of the GDP, which is still lower than the threshold of 40 percent,” he said.According to him, the MEF will continue its efforts to revitalize the economy through the implementation of the ‘Strategic Framework and Program to Restore and Promote Cambodia’s Economic Growth’ as part of living in a new normal way with Covid-19 policy.Secondly, as part of the Public Financial Reform, MEF is preparing for the next step of ‘Accountability for Achievement’ by formulating a framework.Thirdly, MEF will continue to take measures to strengthen the management of state assets and non-tax revenue and modernize the system of non-tax revenue collection by accelerating the establishment of non-tax revenue management system and inventory management system using information technology.The fourth aspect focuses on Public Debt Management. After the successful implementation of the Public Debt Management Strategy 2015-2018 by the government, the country continues to have a sustainable and low-risk debt.Lastly, under the 5th Rectangular Strategy, the government will streamline the public revenue management and step up tax revenue collection.\n",

Secondly, expansion of satellite areas of the city along with tourism products development; and thirdly setting up management and development mechanisms.“In the short-term period, we also need to prepare an architecture plan for building and developing this area in order to be in line with the vision that we set… We also focus on the management of flow of visitors, especially in the context of post-pandemic along with enhancement of mechanism and capacities,” said Samuth.Aun Pornmoniroth, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, said the executive commission has to prepare a budget plan for the implementation of the short-term action plan for 2022-2023 and then submit it to the ministry for review and approval and urged relevant officials to further develop Chong Khneas Ferry Terminal as a standardised tourism terminal.In the first half of 2022, Siem Reap received about 60,000 international tourists, an increase of 1,025 percent compared to the same period in 2021, and over one million domestic tourists, an increase of 798 percent over the same period.On the other hand, there were 387 flights to Siem Reap in the first half of 2022. “Actually, Siem Reap province is a very important cultural tourism destination that attracts tourists from around the world and they wish to see Angkor Wat at least once in life,” said Chhay Sivlin, president of Cambodia Association of Travel Agents.\n",

To date, about 38,000 officials from CLMV have participated in classroom-style courses at its IAI training centres.”In 2018, Singapore upgraded these training centres into Singapore Cooperation Centres (SCCs), to meet the evolving needs of the CLMV countries.The bilateral trade between Cambodia and Singapore reached around $5.2 billion in 2021. While Cambodia’s main export to Singapore includes Kampot pepper, palm sugar, mango and milled rice, the Kingdom imports fuel, machinery, electronics, food, beverages, paper and precious stones from Singapore.“Singapore government established training centres in each of the CLMV countries effectively and efficiently to implement its far-reaching initiatives. The Cambodia-Singapore Training Centre in Phnom Penh was started in March 2002. It is noteworthy that over the last 20 years the centre has trained more than 10,700 Cambodian government officials under the IAI, while more than 16,600 Cambodian government officials have participated in courses under the Singapore Cooperation Programme,” the minister observed.“On behalf of the government of Cambodia we would like to convey our deep gratitude to the government of Singapore for being the prime mover in narrowing the development gaps and deepening Asean integration,” Sokhonn said.Talking at the function, Balakrishnan said, “Cambodia is one of Singapore’s oldest friends. In fact, Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the late King-Father Norodom Sihanouk laid very strong foundations for our relations even before Singapore’s independence, and therefore, even before Cambodia’s travails. Today, our countries both enjoy growing trade and investment and people-to-people links, as well as very close cooperation on human resource development.”While talking about the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), which celebrates its 30th anniversary, the minister pointed out, “It also marks 20 years of Singapore’s technical cooperation with Cambodia under the Initiative for Asean Integration (IAI). We established the Cambodia-Singapore Training Centre in 2002, after Asean leaders launched the IAI in 2000 in order to support capacity building in the newer Asean member states, including Cambodia.”In 2018, Singapore upgraded the IAI Training Centres to Singapore Cooperation Centres (SCCs), intended to serve as an integrated platform for the country to deliver capacity-building programmes more holistically.Talking about the significance of CSCC, he said, “The CSCC was the first Centre to begin operations in July 2018. It has since conducted 76 runs of IAI training courses covering a wide range of topics, including using innovation and technology to promote food security and safety, increasing digital adoption by micro small and medium enterprises and healthcare sectors to accelerate business recovery, enhance the resilience of public health systems, as well as the sharing of best practices on innovation in public policy and governance. The CSCC brings Singapore entities and Asean Dialogue Partners together, including our foreign development assistance agencies in order to provide more relevant and up-to-date capacity-building programmes in Cambodia.”The CSCC has partnered with Civil Service College Singapore, Temasek Foundation, the Cambodian Ministry of Civil Service and the Royal School of Administration to organise a “Leadership Development Programme” for senior Cambodian officials in February 2020.The CSCC is also working with the German Agency for International Cooperation on providing English Language training as part of the “Investment Promotion and Private Sector Development Fellowship Programme” for provincial officials from areas like Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem Reap.Pointing out the challenges faced by all nations in the last few years due to pandemics, the minister said, “The last few years have been very challenging for the whole world, and of course for Cambodia and Singapore too. But I am heartened, and I am sure DPM Prak Sokhonn will agree with me that Singapore and Cambodia have come through this crisis together, stronger and even more confident of our mutual support for one another.”“I recall that when we met here six months ago, we had agreed to expand bilateral cooperation, especially in new areas such as connectivity, infrastructure development, fintech and digital economy. I am here to say that we remain committed to supporting Cambodia.”He also appreciated the rapid changes in the country.“As Cambodia matures, develops and becomes even more advanced – as I was flying in, I noticed you have a spectacular city – it is so obvious that much has happened here. I would also say that our relations have reached new heights.The Cambodia-Singapore Training Centre (CSTC) was established in 2002, following the launch of the IAI in 2000. In 2018, the CSTC was upgraded to CSCC to enhance the delivery of capacity-building programmes for Cambodian officials.The CSCC facilitates a wider scope of development projects, including education services, consultancy projects and services, healthcare services and humanitarian assistance. It partners with reputed Singapore private and public sector entities, such as the Infrastructure Asia, Singapore International Foundation, Temasek Foundation etc, in meeting\n",

      "Global growth recovery and rapid resumption in economic activity will give impetus to Cambodia’s economic growth this year, according to the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC).The growth will be supported by the garment, tourism, agriculture, and construction sectors, according to the latest report of NBC.The Kingdom’s economic growth is expected to be at 5.3 percent this year, higher than the estimated three percent growth in 2021, the bank said.The global growth is expected to be moderate this year due to the better situation of Covid-19 pandemic and this has benefited the operation of production, trade, tourism, and investment.However, the Russia-Ukraine war led to an increase in inflation in oil-related goods and services.In Cambodia, the efficient preventive measures against Covid-19, particularly the vaccination of 94 percent of the total 16 million population pushed the government to reopen the country’s border, removing health measures to the vaccinated foreign tourists, said its governor Chea Chanto.“The domestically favourable factors with the recovery of the global growth have boosted the country’s manufacturing product exports and supported activities in construction and real estate,” Chanto said.Cambodia exported $11,317 million worth of products in the first semester of this year, up 31 percent from the same period last year, while imports rose by four percent to $15,400 million.The report stated that the country’s economic growth would be facing high inflation following the increase in oil prices.“The strength of the banking system has played an important role in absorbing part of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and contributing to the sustainability of business activities, investment and consumption,” Chanto said.The IMF announced on July 26, a 3.2 percent revised downward forecast for global growth in 2022 and 2.9 percent in 2023, citing that the global economy is still reeling from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n",

The sector consists of roughly 1,100 factories and branches, employing approximately 750,000 workers, mostly female.“The garment sector has played an important role in boosting Cambodia’s exports as other garment producing countries are still suffering from the impact of COVID-19,” senior economist Ky Sereyvath, director general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua.\n",

      "Cambodia saw its oil import increase in value in the first half of this year, amid the global increase in crude oil prices following the Russia-Ukraine war.The Kingdom imported $1,910 million worth of oil products in the January-June period of this year, a 25.8 percent increase compared to the same period last year, according to a report of the National Bank of Cambodia.The report was compiled based on the data provided by relevant ministries and institutions.Currently, Cambodia imports all of its petroleum products from Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand as its seabed oil and gas reserves have not been tapped yet.The demand for oil has been on a surge but the country has oil inventory to supply sufficient demand to local consumption, said Penn Sovicheat, under-secretary of state and spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce.“Cambodia has inventory for supplies from 15 to 20 days. If no imports are made, Cambodia has oil to supply sufficiency,” he said.The demand for petroleum products in Cambodia is projected to rise to 4.8 million tonnes in 2030, up from 2.8 million tonnes in 2020, Minister of Mines and Energy Suy Sem said at the Oil, Gas and Power Cambodia 2022 conference last week.Sem urged further investments in the sector to respond to this growing demand.“Government encourages the national and international private sector to invest in the downstream sector, such as refining, importing, storing, transporting and distributing petroleum and petroleum products to ensure the supply of oil and gas for consumers and other development sectors,” he said.Oil prices in Cambodia have soared since the Russia-Ukraine crisis started in February, causing a price rise in common commodities.The ministry shortened the petrol price adjustment from 15 days to 10 days, considering the rapid increase in international crude oil prices.The government has implemented fiscal and financial policies to curb the inflation on common commodities and services to help ease the financial burden of people.\n",

      "Nanning (Xinhua) – At a leading paper factory in south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a production line was running at full steam as orders from ASEAN countries surge this year. “Nearly 90 containers filled with white cardboard produced by the factory are shipped through Qinzhou port every day to ASEAN markets and the number keeps increasing,” said Zhou Ju, logistics department director of Guangxi Jingui Pulp; Paper Co., Ltd., owned by Indonesia’s Asia Pulp & Paper Sinar Mas.Since the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) entered into force in January, trade costs have been further reduced among member countries and related companies have seen tangible benefits. Customs data shows that, in the first half of this year, China’s trade with ASEAN countries reached 2.95 trillion yuan (about 437.8 billion US dollars), a year-on-year increase of 10.6 percent.Zhou said that the raw materials like wood chips, wood pulp, and starch imported from ASEAN countries now enjoy preferential tariffs thanks to the RCEP agreements, and that has greatly saved the cost of the company. The Indonesian company also established a branch in January in Nanning, capital of Guangxi, to manage the forestry affairs of the group in China, Laos, and Cambodia, and seek to expand industrial chains as the company eyes the giant economic cooperation potential among China and ASEAN countries. Companies believe that the implementation of RCEP enables ASEAN and Chinese enterprises to conduct business in a more transparent and clear environment, simplify customs clearance procedures, and facilitate trade and economic exchanges.“The implementation of RCEP has brought real benefits to our company and our partner companies in Malaysia,” said Li Huihuan, deputy general manager of Guangxi Free Trade Zone Sing Nest International Trading Co., Ltd., a Singaporean-funded health food production and processing enterprise in Guangxi.The company has been importing raw materials like edible bird’s nests from Malaysia. Li added that thanks to the simplified customs clearance brought by RCEP, the production and operation efficiency of the enterprise have greatly improved.“The time span from ordering raw materials in Malaysia to receiving goods has been shortened from 15 days to five days, which has greatly reduced our warehousing costs,” Li said.For Chinese companies in Guangxi, RCEP also boosted their confidence to deepen cooperation with ASEAN countries. Liugong Machinery Co., Ltd. transported a large number of loaders to Thailand in January and signed a joint venture agreement with Thai distributor Yontrakarn in February. Zeng Guang’an, chairman and CEO of the company, said that the two sides have been cooperating for 11 years, and they wish to serve Thai clients better with the joint venture.Connected with ASEAN countries by land and sea, Guangxi becomes an important window for exchanges and cooperation between China and RCEP members. A total of 12 air cargo routes have been opened between Guangxi and ASEAN countries, covering almost all major ASEAN countries. \n",

In 2014, the Royal Government set a new target of 60 percent of both rural water supply and sanitation in the Rural Development Strategic Plan 2014-2018.“We have exceeded the target by increasing the coverage of rural water supply and sanitation to more than 70 percent by 2018. As of now, the coverage of rural water supply and sanitation is more than 80 percent,” he said.The Ministry of Rural Development has been implementing the National Action Plan on Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Sanitation Phase II (2019-2023), setting a target of 90 percent coverage by 2023 on access to clean water and rural sanitation.A latest report from the Ministry of Rural Development said that Cambodia is the second country in the world to reduce the percentage of open defecation rates from 82.7 percent in 2000 to 40.6 percent in 2015.This positive result is due to the efforts of the Royal Government combined with the close cooperation of development partners, NGOs and the private sector, it said. \n",

      "Hong Kong (AFP) – Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba led technology stocks lower in Hong Kong on Monday after US authorities put it on a watchlist that could see it delisted in New York if it does not comply with disclosure orders.The market heavyweight sank more than five percent in early trade, pushing it to its lowest level since May and dragging the Hang Seng Tech Index with it.The US securities watchdog on Friday said it added the Chinese firm to a list of more than 250 others that could be booted from Wall Street – where it listed in 2014 – if strict auditing requirements were not met for three consecutive years.The announcement comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing are dragged lower by a range of issues including technology, human rights and Taiwan.It also follows a report last week that founder Jack Ma plans to give up control of Ant Group as part of a strategy to appease Chinese regulators and revive the digital payments unit’s initial public offering. It was hit with a record $2.75 billion fine in April 2021 for anti-competitive practices. Earlier this year, Alibaba removed all executives linked to Ant from Alibaba Partnership, a group that can nominate the majority of Alibaba’s board.Reports about Ma’s decision wiped out Alibaba’s gains from earlier in the week, when the firm announced it would seek a primary listing in Hong Kong to access China’s vast pool of investors.The selling – it sank more than 10 percent in New York – was made worse by concerns about Alibaba’s upcoming earnings report, which\n",

      "AFP – Asian markets were mixed Monday and oil fell as investors assessed data showing further weakness in China’s economy and comments from Federal Reserve officials showing it was wedded to its campaign of interest rate hikes to fight inflation.A strong set of earnings from Wall Street titans Amazon and Apple helped US markets end last week with healthy gains and eased concerns about the impact on consumers of surging inflation and rising borrowing costs.That came after investors took Fed chief Jerome Powell’s post-policy-meeting comments Wednesday as indicating the bank could start to slow down its pace of monetary tightening, providing a much-needed boost to stocks.However, analysts warned that inflation would take time to come down from its four-decade highs and there were undoubtedly more rate hikes to come.And officials backed that up at the weekend, with Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari telling the New York Times that he was “surprised by markets’ interpretation” of the latest Fed meeting statement.“The committee is united in\n",
      "our determination to get inflation back down to two percent, and I think we’re going to continue to do what we need to do until we are convinced that inflation is well on its way back down to two percent – and we are a long way away from that.”That came as Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he did not think the economy was in recession owing to ongoing jobs growth but that inflation remained too high\n",
      "and he was “convinced” more must be done.Still, Treasuries continued to fall, with the 10-year yield at 2.67 percent, well down from June’s peak near 3.50 percent, suggesting expectations for future rates are easing.Figures showing a second successive economic contraction in April-June put the United States in a technical recession but it is not officially considered so until identified as such by the National Bureau of Economic Research.In early Asian trade, investors struggled to extend Wall Street’s lead, with Hong Kong and Shanghai suffering most after another disappointing reading on the Chinese economy.The closely watched Purchasing Managers’ Index of manufacturing activity shrank in July on the back of weak demand and the strict zero-Covid measures imposed in parts of the country.While sweeping Covid curbs have eased in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, sporadic lockdowns in various cities and towns have kept businesses and consumers worried.And there are few signs of an easing of the policy, with officials appearing to emphasise zero-Covid over growth in a Politburo meeting last week.Adding to weakness in Hong Kong was news that US authorities had put market heavyweight Alibaba on a list of firms threatened with New York delisting if they did not comply with disclosure rules.There were also losses in Taipei and Manila.However, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Jakarta and Wellington edged up.The data out of China revived demand concerns in oil markets, sending both main contracts\n",
      "down Monday, following a bounce last week. Brent and WTI both lost more than one percent, and investors are now eyeing a meeting of OPEC and other major producers this week, where they will discuss their deal to raise output slowly.Joe Biden called on Saudi Arabia to open the taps further when he visited last month as he tries to address a crucial driver of inflation around the world.But the kingdom does not appear to have made any such moves so far with the commodity having lost almost all the gains made since Russia’s Ukraine invasion.“The US has expressed optimism about the potential for an OPEC+ supply response, said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.“However, it seems highly unlikely there will be much appetite for a significant increase in production, with Brent still (around) 15 percent down from year-to-date highs and (down) 12 percent in the last month,” he added.“OPEC+ seems more likely to signal a willingness to continue cooperating long-term, but it would be a surprise if the upcoming meeting resulted in a significant policy shift.”\n",

      "$665M Covid-19 stimulus package mitigates impact\n",
      "August 1, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501122943/665m-covid-19-stimulus-package-mitigates-impact/\n",
      "The Cambodian government’s stimulus packages of $665 million in total have mitigated the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, household income, consumption and poverty rate, according to a new research report.The government rolled out rapid cash transfers for the first time in June 2020 among other stimulus measures to counter the impacts of Covid-19 by including 700,000 households which are among the poorest, the most vulnerable and the most impacted by the pandemic into the Cash Transfer Program for Poor and Vulnerable Households.The intervention involved the transfer of $300 million as cash support for poor and vulnerable Cambodian citizens in 2020 through the use of the national IDPoor identification system, and an additional transfer of $365 million in 2021.The cash transfer program has been implemented by the government with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.Alissar Chaker, Resident Representative of UNDP Cambodia, said UNDP Cambodia and the General Secretariat for the National Social Protection Council (GS-NSPC) conducted a socioeconomic impact assessment of the above-mentioned social protection programme using three rounds of longitudinal surveys and econometric modelling techniques.Bazlul Khondker, UNDP senior economic consultant, said in the report that the cash transfer intervention has been found to produce salutary impacts on growth, and the GDP growth rate may improve to -3.55 percent, an improvement of about 0.54 percentage points over the 2020 GDP growth rate of -0.41 percent without the intervention.The simulated impacts for 2021 with cash transfer 2 suggest an improvement of around 0.45 percentage points over the 2021 GDP growth rate of 1.88 percent without the cash transfer intervention 2, according to Khondker, who added that Cambodia’s economy grew by 6.5 percent in 2019 during the pre-pandemic period.“An increase in domestic production also leads to a rise in factor employment or use, and hence factor income or gross value added also known as gross domestic product,” he explained, adding that such a transfer increases household income and consumption that augments demand for goods and services, leading to rising production of domestic output.“Such a direct transfer increases household income and hence consumption. This in turn augments demand for goods and services. The increase in demand for goods and services must be met by enhancing supply of goods and services,” Khondker pointed out.“A major part of the supply increase should also be generated by increasing production of domestic output. An increase in domestic production also leads to a rise in factor employment or use, and hence factor income or gross value added also known as gross domestic product,” he said.The unemployment rate was likely to improve to 4.2 percent under the cash transfer intervention 1 scenario from 4.8 percent in 2020 and in the case of 2021, it was likely to drop to 2.98 percent with cash transfer intervention 2 from 3.60 percent without cash transfer intervention 2, according to the report. A large number of workers are employed in low productivity, informal sectors, mainly in services and agriculture where their average working hours per week are low, according to the report.The report titled “Socioeconomic Impacts of the Covid-19 Cash Transfer Programme in Cambodia: Micro and Macro-level Evaluation” adds that the average working hours per week were less than the 40-hour threshold, leading to high rates of underemployment. The estimated employment intensities across activities are high – suggesting that a decline in domestic output may spur the unemployment rate.The report points out that the poverty rate, which could jump to 17.6 percent in the 2020 period in the absence of cash transfer interventions, is likely to decline to 11.2 percent with cash transfer interventions in 2021, which suggests around a 7.0 percentage point gain in poverty reduction with cash transfers.“Both consumption and poverty impacts have been found to be favourable under the cash transfer intervention scenarios compared to scenarios without the cash transfers. In particular, cash transfers have augmented the incomes of poverty-stricken household groups such as the landless, small farmers, non-farm households, and low-educated households,” the report stated.Chan Narith Under-Secretary of State of Ministry of Economy and Finance, said Cambodia’s policymakers, civil society, academia, and development partners are encouraged to build on these valuable insights in their efforts for reducing poverty and vulnerability, leaving no one behind.“We hope that these empirical findings serve as critical evidence for building a strong case to further invest in social protection and for informing the Royal Government of Cambodia’s decision-making on the Kingdom’s future development model,” said Narith, who is also Secretary General of GS-NSPC.\n",

      "It was to be a professional event, a gathering of business stalwarts in Cambodia for networking, but the reception hosted by Aquarii BD Cambodia turned out to be a sociable and enjoyable evening marked with laughter and backslapping.The cocktail party at Prince Brewing on Friday evening was attended by senior ranked officials from, among others, Phillip Bank, CKHG Consultancy, IPS Cambodia, MBCC, JBAC, Prince Brewing, DFDL, Indochina Research, Kadin Indonesia, Khmer Times, AMCHAM Cambodia, Khmer Enterprise, Meridian, IndoCham, Kocham, RHT Law, Cambodia Investment, and YEAC.Aquarii guests mingled around, caught up with friends and associates, made new acquaintances and connections, and learned the latest and juiciest market information.There was, of course, a lot of exchange of name cards.Lea Morada, Research Director at Indochina Research, said she was at the reception to meet people out to expand their network to different industries.“We’re hoping that maybe soon in the future, we’ll be able to partner with some of these people here in helping them in their businesses, market-entry, understanding about the Cambodian market, and of course hopefully, to develop friends also.“Beyond being colleagues, we hope to develop long-term friendships also with the people,” said Morada.Cynthia Liaw, CEO of Panda Commercial Bank, said, “This is actually a really good event by Aquarii for their partners and friends. And most of the partners are well-established businesses and entrepreneurs in Cambodia. So I find that a networking event like this is very good to link with new friends as well as to catch up with old friends.”Kim Hyun Tae, the joint CEO of My Work Cambodia said, “At every event, we have the opportunity to meet somebody. It is good for me when I meet people as I get the opportunity to introduce My Work Cambodia. I gave out my name card to over 20 people. So it’s enough for me.”Michael Tan, CEO and Founder of Aquarii said in his welcoming remarks: “This event was intended to be a small event. We bring together our partners and friends from various business circles to get to know one another, identify areas of synergy, and exchange ideas and views on how they can collaborate on projects.“This being our first event, and because of requests and expressions of interest from various business contexts for a networking event, we decided to open up the event, make it a bit more open, more inclusive, and make it more social.”According to Tan, Aquarii is an advisory and consultancy service firm that focuses on business strategies, strategic communication, connecting business, creating opportunities, and building partnerships together.“This is our inaugural event, but going forward, other than networking events for visiting businesses and investors, we hope that our events will be smaller scale and more focused.”“It can be small group discussions, it can be closed-door dialogues with key position holders, key office holders, key stakeholders, and subject matter experts so that the interaction can be more productive and the desired outcome can be more effective,” Tan said.Tan added Aquarii will not discount having industrial events, stating that it all depends on the context and the requirements of the businesses and investors.When asked about how he thought the event was going, Tan said, “I think I’m having a lot of fun.  A lot of the attendees here are quite satisfied and quite happy with the interaction that they’re having. Because all the participants here are from different industries, different sectors, and different backgrounds.”“In other words, unlike a business chamber, which can be very restrictive by the governance and the constitution of the need to be the collective interest of their members, Aquarii is a private entity. We are able to organise such events so that we can pull in members and people from different sectors and different backgrounds.”“Because we believe in win-win collaboration and the power of aggregation, which means that the market is actually big enough for everyone, so long as they are prepared to work together,” he said.He said that what he realised during his four and a half years as an investor in Cambodia, a lot of business entities still choose to isolate themselves and work according to their own area of interest but if they can aggregate their efforts and their subject matter together, they can actually secure more collaborative projects. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501122953/cbc-introduces-credit-risk-heat-map/\n",
      "Credit Bureau (Cambodia) Co., Ltd (CBC) has launched an advanced business intelligence tool in the Kingdom for member financial institutions to monitor credit risk levels across multiple geographies.According to CBC, Credit Risk Heat Map is an interactive map enabling C-level executives and senior managers from lending institutions to conveniently navigate their institution’s credit risk from one location to another.Heatmap is designed to be used together with Data Analytics Report (DAR) rather than as a standalone tool so that financial institutions can reap maximum value to inform their decision-making.In 2020, CBC revamped its DAR suite of business intelligence dashboards that enables senior executives from member financial institutions to carry out strategic and tactical monitoring of their performance.Oeur Sothearoath, CEO, CBC said, “Over the last few years, our financial sector has been undergoing digital transformation and making a leap towards data analytics. With the progressive growth of the credit market, today, we cater to 180 member banks, microfinance institutions, leasing companies and rural credit institutions. On the one hand, our members are expanding their operations to new markets. On the other hand, they also need to ensure that they are operating at optimum risk level in the existing markets. Hence, we developed the Heat map to complement DAR based on evolving needs of our members.”Heatmap not only reflects the latest trends in the market but also meets the emerging data needs of financial institutions. Considering the needs of members, CBC has added dynamic navigational features to drill down to commune level performance, compare an institution’s credit quality and restructured loan performance to sector average and extract data from the map for further analysis.With insights on credit performance, history and transactions of borrowers at commune, district and province levels, financial institutions can re-strategize portfolio risks, market strategies and product planning based on the needs of their consumers in target geographies. Credit Risk Heat Map together with DAR will increase the accuracy of risk avoidance, default accounts inquiries, and ensure a safer and higher loan quality for the financial institutions by offering data insights.\n",

      "AFP – An Irishman at risk of losing his farm. An American having suicidal thoughts. An 84-year-old widow’s lost life savings: People caught in the meltdown of crypto lender Celsius are pleading for their money back.Hundreds of letters have poured into the judge overseeing the firm’s multi-billion-dollar bankruptcy and they are heavy with anger, shame, desperation and, frequently, regret.“I knew there were risks,” said a client whose letter was unsigned. “It seemed a worthwhile risk.”Celsius and its CEO Alex Mashinsky had billed the platform as a safe place for people to deposit their crypto currencies in exchange for high interest, while the firm lent out and invested those deposits.But as the value of highly volatile crypto currencies plummeted – bitcoin alone has shed over 60 percent since November – the firm faced mounting troubles until it froze withdrawals in mid-June.The company owed $4.7 billion to its users, according to a court filing earlier this month, and the endgame is unclear.The letters – posted to a public online court docket – come from around the world and recount tragic results of users’ money being frozen.“From that hard-working single mom in Texas struggling with past-due bills, to the teacher in India with all his hard-earned money deposited in Celsius – I believe I can speak for most of us when I say I feel betrayed, ashamed, depressed, angry,” wrote one client who signed their letter E.L.While the letters vary in their level of sophistication about the crypto world – from self-confessed novices to all-in evangelists – and the monetary impacts range from a few hundred dollars to seven-figure sums, nearly all agree on one thing.“I have been a loyal Celsius customer since 2019 and feel completely lied to Alex Mashinsky,” wrote a client who AFP is not identifying to protect his privacy. “Alex would talk about how Celsius is safer than banks.”Many of the letters point to the CEO’s AMA (Ask Mashinsky Anything) online chats as key to their confidence in him and the platform, which presented itself as stable until days before it froze users’ funds.Assurances before fall“Celsius has one of the best risk management teams in the world. Our security team and infrastructure are second to none,” the firm wrote on June 7.“We have made it through crypto downturns before (this is our fourth!). Celsius is prepared,” the firm wrote.The message also said the company had the reserves to pay its obligations, and withdrawals were being processed as normal.One client, who reported having $32,000 in crypto locked up at Celsius, noted the impact. “Right up until the end, the retail investor received assurance,” the client wrote to the judge.But that changed quickly, and on June 12 Celsius announced the freeze: “We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations.”Some clients got the news in a message from the company. “By the time I finished the e-mail, I had collapsed onto the floor with my head in my hands and I fought back tears,” wrote one man who had about $50,000 in assets with Celsius.The clients who said they were hardest hit, including a man who said he placed $525,000 he got from a government loan on Celsius, disclosed they had considered killing themselves.Others reported heavy stress, lack of sleep and feelings of deep shame for putting their retirement savings or their children’s college money into a platform that was far riskier than they knew.“As a private unregulated company, Celsius does not come under any requirement for disclosure,” is how the Washington Post summarised.Celsius did not reply to a request for comment on the clients’ letters. For people like one 84-year-old woman, who only had her roughly $30,000 in crypto savings on Celsius for a month, their hope lies in the bankruptcy proceedings.“It’s just not unusual for people to come out of something like this with zero,” said Don Coker, an expert witness on banking and finance.\n",

It is also part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has provided significant economic growth to Cambodia.Meanwhile, the government is studying two major development projects in Sihanoukville – industry and services. The expressway project also boasts of development with the contribution of the Chinese government to facilitate faster travel,” he pointed out.The Minister also recalled his visit to a company in China and asked its founders to continue to invest in Cambodia to diversify and create conditions for more new jobs for Cambodians.   Kang said that with good policies and investment attractiveness for the first half of 2023, the company will establish another large tire factory in Sihanoukville Economic Zone (SEZ) with investment capital of more than $300 million.In June 2022, the company organised a trade fair for Silk Road, in which China will accept some of Cambodia’s agricultural products to China, with the company cooperating with the Ministry of Health and the Department of Labor and Vocational Training.Heng believes that the establishment of a large tire factory will provide many benefits for Cambodian farmers to grow rubber to provide the company with strength. Meanwhile, more workers are needed to supply the company’s additional production chain.He added that with the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, it will be easier to export and import more products between the two countries and the rapid expansion of the company\n",

      "Both pacts are well-timed intervention in Cambodia’s quest for a Least Developed Country graduation, likely by 2028 and the country’s planned endeavour to achieve the upper-middle income and high-income status by 2030 and 2050 respectivelyXinhua – The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade pact and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) have provided wider exporting markets for Cambodia, officials said on Thursday.Ly Thuch, president of Cambodia’s National Committee for the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), said thanks to these free trade agreements, Cambodia’s total export to other RCEP member countries totalled 3.28 billion US dollars in the first half of 2022, up 10 percent year-on-year.“Overall, these positive developments have transformed Cambodia into a more important and potential center for production, businesses and investments in the region, with larger and more competitive exporting markets for investors from all over the world,” he said in a speech at the Policy Dialogue on the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2022.Both RCEP and the CCFTA took effect on Jan. 1 this year.RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 ASEAN member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Thuch said as the region and the world continue to face increasingly acute challenges including geo-political competition, military, trade and technological wars, climate change, and monetary policy tightening, upholding multilateralism, international cooperation and free trade must be a priority. “We must adhere to the spirit of openness and support for the multilateral trading system as well as strengthen multilateralism,” he said, highlighting the need to promote the openness for international trade and reduce trade barriers, “particularly on strategic commodities such as food, medicine, and energy.” Cambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman Penn Sovicheat said both RCEP and the CCFTA contribute to Cambodia’s export growth. “Both pacts are also a well-timed intervention in Cambodia’s quest for a Least Developed Country (LDC) graduation, likely by 2028 and the country’s planned endeavour to achieve the upper-middle income and high-income statuses by 2030 and 2050, respectively,” he said. According to a World Bank research paper, Cambodia ranked third after Vietnam and Malaysia in terms of real income gains and export growth under RCEP. \n",

      "Cambodia has seen the successful sale of carbon credits in the global voluntary carbon market, earning $11.6 million from 2016 to 2020, a senior official said on Saturday.Ministry of Environment’s secretary of state and spokesman Neth Pheaktra said the kingdom has sold three carbon credit projects at the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in Mondulkiri province, the REDD+ Project at the Southern Cardamom National Park in Koh Kong province, and the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary in Stung Treng province.He added that large companies that have purchased carbon credits in the global voluntary carbon market include Disney and Gucci, among others.“Full peace, political stability and people’s better livelihoods have given us enough time and resources to protect and preserve our existing natural resources,” he told Xinhua.According to the spokesman, Cambodia and Indonesia are the only two member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that have sold carbon credits.Pheaktra said the proceeds from the sale of carbon credits have been used to support efforts in natural resources protection and local community development through creating new jobs in the ecotourism industry.He said companies buying carbon credits from Cambodia based their decisions on the assessment by an independent agency, which confirmed that the country was capable of adequately protecting natural resources.The spokesman said Cambodia has added at least five more sanctuaries to its list of carbon credit sales and that the ministry of environment and its partner organizations are currently seeking voluntary buyers.“We’re optimistic that more large companies will buy our carbon credits in coming years,” he said.Pheaktra said Cambodia currently has more than 70 protected areas and biodiversity corridors with a total area of 7.3 million hectares, equivalent to 41 percent of the land area of Cambodia.\n",

      "Still reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the global economy is facing an increasingly murky and uncertain outlook, according to the latest report released on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The World Economic Outlook Update July 2022: Gloomy and More Uncertain, highlights the significant consequences of the stalling of the world’s three main economic powerhouses – the United States, China and the major European economies.“The outlook has darkened significantly since April,” said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF Economic Counsellor and Director of Research.“The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one”.The baseline forecast for global growth is for it to slow from 6.1 per cent last year, to 3.2 per cent in 2022 – 0.4 per cent lower than forecast in the last Outlook update in April.Three key economiesWith higher-than-expected inflation – especially in the US and the largest European economies – global financial conditions are becoming tighter.In the US, reduced household purchasing power and tighter monetary policy will drive growth down to 2.3 per cent this year and one percent next year, according to the outlook.China’s slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, with negative effects from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continuing.Moreover, further lockdowns and a deepening real estate crisis there has pushed growth down to 3.3 per cent this year – the slowest in more than four decades, excluding the pandemic.And in the Eurozone, growth has been revised down to 2.6 per cent this year and 1.2 percent in 2023, reflecting spillovers from the Ukraine war and tighter monetary policy.“As a result, global output contracted in the second quarter of this year,” said Mr. Gourinchas.InflationDespite the global slowdown, inflation has been revised up, in part due to rising food and energy prices.This year it is anticipated to reach 6.6 per cent in advanced economies and 9.5 per cent in emerging market and developing economies – representing upward revisions of 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points respectively. And it is projected to remain elevated for longer.Broadened inflation in many economies reflects “the impact of cost pressures from disrupted supply chains and historically tight labour markets,” the IMF official stated.Downward risksThe report outlines some risks ahead, including that the war in Ukraine could end European gas supply from Russia altogether; rising prices could cause widespread food insecurity and social unrest; and geopolitical fragmentation may impede global trade and cooperation.Inflation could remain stubbornly high if labour markets remain overly tight or inflation expectations are too optimistic and prove more costly than expected.And renewed Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns threaten to further suppress China’s growth.“In a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialize…inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6 per cent this year and two per cent next year, a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970,” said the IMF economist.“Under this scenario, both the United States and the Euro area experience near-zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world”.Destabilizing inflationCurrent inflation levels represent a clear risk to macroeconomic stability, according to the outlook.Responding to the situation, central banks in advanced economies are withdrawing monetary support faster than expected, while many in emerging market and developing economies began raising interest rates last year.“The resulting synchronized monetary tightening across countries is historically unprecedented, and its effects are expected to bite, with global growth slowing next year and inflation decelerating,” said Mr Gourinchas.Policy prioritiesWhile acknowledging that tighter monetary policy would have economic costs, the IMF official upheld that delaying it would only exacerbate hardship.And hampered by difficulties in coordinating creditor agreements, how and whether debt can be restructured, remains unpredictable.He argued that domestic policies responding to the impacts of high energy and food prices should focus on those most affected, without distorting prices.“Governments should refrain from hoarding food and energy and instead look to unwind barriers to trade such as food export bans, which drive world prices higher,” advised the IMF official.Meanwhile, mitigating climate change continues to require prompt multilateral action to limit emissions and raise investment to accelerate a “green transition”.Policymakers are urged to ensure that measures are temporary and only cover energy shortfalls and climate policies.Teetering on the edgeFrom climate transition and pandemic preparedness to food security and debt distress, multilateral cooperation is key, said the IMF economist.“Amid great challenge and strife, strengthening cooperation remains the best way to improve economic prospects and mitigate the risk of geoeconomic fragmentation,” he underscored.

      "Non-tax revenue law passed, no burden for consumers\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501121538/non-tax-revenue-law-passed-no-burden-for-consumers/\n",
      "Cambodia’s National Assembly yesterday approved the law on non-tax revenue management that will not add new tax and customs burdens for consumers five years after it was initiated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) for the country to have an updated comprehensive legal instrument.The National Assembly passed the law on non-tax revenue management with 96 votes out of 106. The law—initiated by MEF for drafting in 2017 to enhance the legal framework—consists of 11 Chapters with 101 Articles and stipulates the determination of core institution, institutional structures and mechanisms of non-tax collection and management.Aun Pornmoniroth, Minister of MEF representing the government, said the new law also states types of non-tax revenues, processes of collection from planning to reporting, modernization of management by utilizing information technology, non-tax debts, conflict resolutions, inspection, auditing, monitoring, evaluation, encouragement, punishment and penalties.“Non-tax revenue is a very big part of the national budget revenue that covers broadly and are from many sources of sectors and activities under responsibilities of ministries and institutions at both national and sub-national levels,” Pornmoniroth said, adding that the revenue accounts for 2-3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year.The law will also fulfill the loopholes in practical experiences both at national and international levels in terms of empowerment, division of responsibilities and full connectedness between ministries, institutions, sub-national administration and revenue collecting body, the MEF.The responsibility of the ministry is to regulate, monitor and push for the collection of this type of revenue that plays a vital role in the structure of the national revenue budget that previously had relied heavily on tax revenue under the existing enacted tax law that generally regulates revenue collected from private sector and consumers.“However, this revenue [non-tax revenue] is a type of by-sector revenue that is very complicated to manage, while collection has not yet reached its maximum potential as there has not been a clear base of legal framework to assure effective management,” Pornmoniroth said.Chheang Vun, Chairman of the Economic, Financial, Banking and Auditing Committee of the National Assembly, said the new law will help increase national revenue, and encourage budget distribution on the right targets but not put any new burden on consumers who are the actors in the economy after it is passed.“I would like to stress that the law on the non-tax revenue that we are discussing here will not add new burden to our consumers as it is neither tax nor customs but it will strengthen the state’s revenue through empowering the government to utilize the budget. After this, [the government] will have to collect and manage this revenue well,” Vun said.Chapter 2 of the law consists of 43 articles — from 4 to 46. Article 4 of the first section of this chapter that stipulates the types of non-tax revenues states that this revenue is divided into revenues from allocation of state properties, public enterprises and financially autonomous entities, public services, penalties and punishment and others.Article 6 of the chapter points out that the revenue from selling and swapping private properties of the state as immovable properties allocated by following the rules and procedures set in relevant applicable laws and regulations is also included in the category of non-revenue.Article 8 states that the revenue from selling and swapping private properties of the state as immovable properties include revenue from selling land, while Article 9 includes the revenue from renting the state properties—land, building, construction, infrastructure, equipment, transportation means, machineries — as the rent as the part for the state after profit division as stipulated in an agreement.Article 13 states that the government can generate revenue from partnership arrangements investment between the government and private sector in terms of the construction of public infrastructure or supplying public services such as transportation and logistics services.The transportation and logistics services include roads, bridges, railways, airports, ports, parking lots and telecommunications, production and distribution of electrical power, pipelines for oil and gas, and other public services in mines and energy sectors, according to Article 13.Article 20 states that in case enacted laws or regulations regarding establishment of public enterprises or financially autonomous entities do not stipulate the determination or division of dividends as per a set rate as percentage of net profit or surplus, they are obliged to pay dividends or cash surplus at least 10 percent to the national budget.Article 21 says that the finance minister has the right to demand that enterprises or financially autonomous entities pay in part or fully the idle capital into the national budget if they are found not in need to investment or development.Chapter 10 indicates that unauthorised persons who collect non-tax revenue shall be imprisoned from one to three years with fines from 50 to 100 million riels, while people who are authorized but collect other revenues other than the non-tax shall be imprisoned from one month to one year with fines from 1 to 4 million riels.Article 97 states that any authorized person who commits offences stipulated in chapter 10 as corruption offences shall be placed in the exclusive responsibility of Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) to undertake investigation and file the case in courts. \n",

      "Dalton Wong clinches Asia Responsible Enterprise Award for the company’s CSR initiativesWhen Speedwind Distributions Co. Ltd recently bagged the Asia Responsible Enterprise Award’s (Area) ‘Outstanding and Exemplary Achievements in Sustainability and Responsible Entrepreneurship Award’ in the Social Empowerment Category for its ‘Giving with Heart’ CSR initiative, it was a deserving honour for the contributions of its chairman Dalton Wong.More than 500 Asian businesses and leaders from 19 countries have won the Area awards for championing sustainable and responsible entrepreneurship since its launch in 2011. The award categories are Social Empowerment, Investment in People, Health Promotion, Green Leadership, Corporate Governance, Circular Economy Leadership, and Responsible Business Leadership.Wong initiated the ‘Giving with Heart’ CSR activities in 2018.Talking about the recognition, Wong said, “Despite the challenges and difficulties during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company even carried out more CSR activities between 2020 and 2021, to help flood victims and their families as well as those who faced economic hardship and challenges as a result of the pandemic.”Explaining the rationale for conducting various CSR initiatives, Wong told Khmer Times, “We do not classify or consider an activity or initiative to be more significant than another. We believe that all activities that we undertake and are committed to will benefit the target beneficiaries, whether they are just 50 families affected by the floods or a few hundred students who need school materials for their studies.”“We are fortunate to have been a beneficiary of the Cambodian economy, and we must therefore always find a way to help members of the community who are in need,” he pointed out.“With a strong commitment from all the stakeholders of Speedwind, we will continue our CSR initiative for as long as the company is in operation. As a responsible member of the Cambodian community and a beneficiary of its economy, we believe that the company and its employees must always find ways to help members of the local community who are in need.”Some of the CSR activities and social support initiatives that Speedwind organised include Covid-19 Donation Programme, Flood Relief Aid, Education Aid for Rural and Underprivileged Communities, Hiring Programme for Disabled Minorities and Gender Equality Employment Programme.Wong, an entrepreneur with extensive experience in distribution, founded Speedwind – which became a top distribution service company in the Kingdom – in 2018.“Speedwind achieved a very strong distribution coverage nationwide and was able to grow its 8,000 points of distribution to more than 30,000,” he said.Wong, an Indonesian, who has been visiting Cambodia since 2009, decided to establish his business here after realising the attractive growth potential due to the Kingdom’s pro-business and pro-investment approach.While talking about his businesses in the country, Wong said, “Other than SpeedWind, our group also owns one of the most successful Business Process Outsourcing services under Massive Distributions. It offers merchant acquisition and management services to financial institutions, as well as the implementation and management of loyalty programs for B2B2C. We also operate one of the largest digital screens in Cambodia under Pixled Media, an IT solutions company, an HR recruitment and placement company and a company with dis-infection services. Our most recent venture is Massive Beverage which distributes APB products in Sihanoukville.”Speedwind has three regional headquarters and 42 local offices that cover all 25 provinces in Cambodia.He has been involved in various businesses for around 20 years, covering multiple industries and sectors, from international distribution to brand licensing, retail, project fit-outs, etc.“I am really proud to say that one of the biggest personal accomplishments was that I fulfilled my wish to travel to all the capital cities of Southeast Asian countries before I was 30.”When asked whether he had further expansion plans for Speedwind in the country, Wong replied: “Speedwind started as a last mile company and we are planning to use technology to improve the efficiency of the operations and to increase the points of distribution from traditional trade to all aspects of modern trading activities.”Talking about the major challenges he faced while conducting business in the country, Wong said, “When I first started the business in Cambodia, there were the usual challenges that most businesses encountered as the laws and regulations for commercial entities and activities were not as clear and information was difficult to come by.”“However, the Royal Government has greatly reformed and transformed its systems and processes, and provided greater clarity on various laws and regulations, culminating in the recently announced new investment law from CDC. Cambodia has become, without doubt, a much more pro-business and pro-investment destination, especially when compared to other developing countries or emerging economies.”Wong, who has recently been appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Cambodia-Vietnam chapter of KADIN (Kamar Dagang dan Industri Indonesia), the apex business chamber in Indonesia, also talked about the upcoming activities of the chamber.“I hope we can help contribute to a further strengthening of bilateral relations between Cambodia and Indonesia through greater trade and investment activities and initiatives. One such activity we are planning is an investment roadshow to Indonesia in the coming months,” he said.While explaining the significance of conducting more awareness campaigns about the business-friendly nature of the Kingdom among more businesspeople, he said, “Just a couple of days ago, when I hosted a group of businessmen bikers from Indonesia in Siem Reap, one of them remarked, ‘I was shocked to see how peaceful Cambodia is, back home we thought this country is still at war’. This shows there is still a lack of awareness and understanding about how much Cambodia has progressed, and there is a need for IndoCham and Kadin to help socialise and raise awareness about both our countries.”“Therefore, activities that will be planned in the future will have to focus on socialising both countries’ people to learn more about Cambodia and Indonesia, so that their respective businesses and investors are more aware of the growth potential and investment opportunities that both offer to each other,” he added. \n",

      "AFP – The United States is set to release key data on economic growth Thursday and global investors are watching closely as the world’s largest economy flirts with the recession – while President Joe Biden walks a political tightrope.Though Biden says he is confident the US economy is not suffering a downturn, a report showing a second consecutive quarter of negative growth – meeting one of the common definitions of a recession – would increase fears of a wider downturn.With crucial midterm elections just over three months away, the stakes could not be higher, and the Biden administration has spent the past week talking up the positive signs in the US economy, including job growth and solid consumer spending.It would be highly unusual for an economy still adding jobs at a rapid pace, and with near record-low unemployment, to fall into recession.The consensus forecast among analysts is for an annualized 0.5 percent increase in the gross domestic product in the second quarter, after a 1.6 percent decline in the first three months of the year.But many economists say recent figures suggest GDP may have contracted in the April-June period.With the labour market showing some signs of cooling and supersized interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve slowing the economy – the latest coming on Wednesday – many economists say the recession discussion is more a matter of when\n",

      "AFP – Asian and European markets rose Thursday following a surge on Wall Street fuelled by hopes that the Federal Reserve could slow its pace of inflation-fighting interest rate hikes.The dollar also struggled to bounce back from a sell-off – sitting at a three-week low against the yen – that came in response to comments by Fed chief Jerome Powell suggesting its next super-sized increase could be its last.However, analysts cautioned that the initial joy, which sent New York’s three main indexes soaring, could be short-lived as the global economy continued to face several headwinds and inflation would likely not come down quickly.As expected, the Fed lifted borrowing costs 75 basis points to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, close to the neutral level it considers neither stimulating nor slowing economic growth.Forecasts have rates going as high as 3.8 percent in 2023, as the bank tries to control runaway inflation.There is a growing concern that the sharp rise in rates is bearing down on the world’s top economy and could send it into recession.In his post-meeting comments, however, Powell said he did not consider that was the case, because “there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well”.He did note that growth was slowing.Powell added that officials would not give any guidance on their next move, instead taking each decision on a meeting-to-meeting basis.While he said another “unusually large increase could be appropriate” in September and officials “wouldn’t hesitate” to lift by one percentage point, markets took heart from the suggestion that the bank was ready to take its foot off the gas towards the end of the year.On Wall Street, the Dow and S&P rallied and the Nasdaq soared more than four percent – its best one-day rise since late 2020 – as tech firms caught a wave of optimism. The sector is more susceptible to higher rates.And Asia followed suit, though with more muted gains.Shanghai, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Mumbai, Manila, Jakarta and Wellington were also well in the green.But Hong Kong dipped as the city’s de facto central bank followed the Fed in lifting rates owing to its currency peg.London, Paris and Frankfurt opened with gains.The prospect of a slower pace of rate hikes weighed on the dollar against most other currencies, and on Thursday it hit its lowest level against the yen since July 6.There was a warning that the positive mood likely will not last, however.“This market move is the victory of hope over experience,” Jeffrey Rosenberg, at BlackRock Inc, told Bloomberg Television. “I’d be a little bit cautious here.”And Citigroup’s Andrew Hollenhorst and Veronica Clark added that traders appeared to be misjudging Powell’s remarks.“We read Chair Powell’s press conference as more hawkish than the market’s interpretation,” they said, adding that inflation readings excluding food and energy will “push the Fed to hike more aggressively than they or markets anticipate”.All eyes are now on the release of second-quarter growth data later Thursday. After a 1.6 percent contraction in the previous three months, another negative reading would put the economy into a technical recession.An expected phone call between Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping will also be high on the agenda for investors as the world’s superpowers try to navigate a period of rising tensions. Updates on US tariffs and Taiwan will be among the main areas of focus.Oil prices rose after data showed a big drop in US stockpiles, while Powell’s comments on the economy eased recession concerns and the weaker dollar made the commodity cheaper for buyers with other currencies. \n",

      "Cambodian senior official today shared some insights to the Policy Dialogue on the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2022 organised by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP).This policy dialogue also serves as a venue to discuss major development challenges that Cambodia is currently facing and available policy options to address them, said Ly Thuch, Senior Minister and President of National Committee of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (NA-ESCAP).Over the past two years, he continued, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis has damaged the socio-economic progress in developing countries achieved under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Ly Thuch said at present, the region and the world are continuing to face increasingly acute challenges with complicated and unpredictable manner to the development, including geo-political rivalries, military, trade and technological wars, climate change, monetary policy tightening etc. These factors have been causing changes in the global economic architecture and disrupting the globalisation trend, which has significantly reduced the global value chain and productivity.“In this circumstance, we must adhere to the spirit of openness and support for the multilateral trading system as well as strengthen multilateralism, especially promote the openness for international trade and reduce trade barriers, particularly on strategic commodities such as food, medicine, and energy, in order to foster sustainable economic growth and enhance the resilience of regional and global value chains,” he underlined.Taking this rare opportunity, Senior Minister Thuch briefly informed the participants about the Covid-19 situation and recent economic development in Cambodia. Under the guidance and leadership of Hun Sen, Prime Minister of Cambodia, as of today (July 25, 2022), the Royal Government has achieved the vaccination rate of more than 94 percent of the total population of 16 million. On socio-economic front, the Royal Government of Cambodia has been formulating and implementing concrete policy measures to attract additional foreign investments by building infrastructure and improving the transportation system – both soft and hard, improving trade facilitation, developing human resource, setting up IT and digital system as well as developing financial sector.In particular, he stressed, the Royal Government of Cambodia has expanded wider exporting markets by establishing various free trade agreements, namely: (1). Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), (2). Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, and (3). Cambodia-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which will come into effect soon.Thanks to these openness policies of Cambodia’s total export to other member countries of RCEP totalled $3.28 billion in the first half of 2022, up 10 percent year-on-year, he said.Overall, these positive developments have transformed Cambodia into a more important and potential centre for production, businesses, and investments in the region, with larger and more competitive exporting markets for investors from all over the world, Thuch underlined.

      "The demand for petroleum products in Cambodia is projected to rise to 4.8 million tons in 2030, up from 2.8 million tons in 2020, the country’s Minister of Mines and Energy Suy Sem said on Wednesday.Speaking at the Oil, Gas and Power Cambodia 2022 conference here, Sem said the demand will increase to 8.3 million tons in 2040.“Further investments in this sector are needed in order to respond to this growing demand,” he said.Currently, Cambodia imports all of its petroleum products from Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand as its seabed oil and gas reserves have not been tapped yet.According to the Ministry of Commerce, the Southeast Asian nation spent $971 million on imports of petrol and diesel in the first five months of 2022, up 57 percent from $617 million over the same period last year.Oil prices in Cambodia have soared since the Russia-Ukraine crisis burst out in February.The Ministry of Commerce’s oil price list showed that regular petrol costs 4,800 riel ($1.17) per liter on Wednesday, while diesel costs 5,300 riel ($1.3).The figures indicated that the prices of regular petrol and diesel rose 6.6 percent and 25 percent, respectively compared to the prices dated in early February.

      "The Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has expressed interest in strengthening bilateral cooperation between Cambodia and Nigeria, as well as conducting a study on the use and development of the energy sector in Cambodia.During a courtesy call and discussion with Suy Sem, Minister of Mines and Energy on Monday, Folakemi Ibidunni Akinleye praised Cambodia for its management of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the development of the mining, energy and oil sectors. Nigeria has solid development experience in both areas.She also expressed interest in the development of the industrial sector in Cambodia, as well as the new investment law and Cambodian investors.It was the first meeting between the two sides on future investments in the sector.Suy Sem stated that Cambodia welcomes all investors who want to invest in these sectors, while Cambodia has no political bias – especially in discussing ways and means to further enhance the relations between Cambodia and Nigeria.Cambodia has high potential for developing renewable energy resources even though the country has not attracted much international investment in renewable energy till 2020, he said.To attract more investment in renewable energy, the government could improve renewable energy governance, adopt clear targets, develop an effective regulatory framework, improve project bankability and facilitate market entry for international investors, according to reports.Cambodia is highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change and it is advised that the country focuses more on developing renewable energy as part of climate change mitigation measures.Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world, the 8th largest exporter, and has the tenth largest proven reserves. Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40 percent of GDP and 80 percent of government earnings.In addition to its petroleum resources, Nigeria also has a wide array of underexploited mineral resources, which include coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, lead and zinc. \n",

      "Japanese industrial machinery manufacturer Altech Asia Pacific Co Ltd (Altech) in Thailand is planning to open its factory in Cambodia, Heng Sovannarith, commercial attaché at Cambodian embassy in Bangkok told Khmer Times on Tuesday.According to Sovannarith, Altech’s president Hiroshi Izaki discussed the plan with him at a meeting at the Cambodian Embassy on the same day he proposed to open the facility at Poipet Special Economic Zone.“I suggested that they open the factory in the special economic zone as it could not only bring trade benefits for the company but also allow it to supply printing and packaging materials to other firms in the country,” Sovannarith said.The low labour costs and tax incentives provided by the government along with preferential treatment from the trading partners are among the reasons that attracted the Japanese firm to Cambodia, the official said.The Cambodian government had launched 12 special economic zones along the Cambodia-Thai borders in line with the Thailand Plus-One Strategy.Sovannarith explained that Thailand-Plus-One is a business model in which a Japanese company with a manufacturing base in Thailand relocates its labour-intensive processes to neighbouring countries. “If they set up a factory here, they will be able to supply their packaging products to small and medium enterprises in our country as these companies are currently facing the issue of low-quality packaging,” he said, adding that Altech is specialized in the manufacturing of high-quality printing and packaging materials.Using the Southern Economic Corridor, Cambodia aims to establish supply chains near both Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, where Japanese companies are concentrated. In other words, Cambodia is expected to play a huge role in the development of the special economic zones in the Mekong region.Hiroshi will come to Cambodia in the near future and meet local experts, he added, but did not disclose the investment intended for the business expansion plan. “It’s still at a preliminary stage and they are yet to visit Cambodia,” he said.Hiroshi has requested that the embassy send him a list of Japanese companies operating in Cambodia and information regarding forthcoming trade exhibitions, Sovannarith said.Based in Japan, Altech has units in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.Another Japanese company, Sumitomo Corporation expanded to Cambodia early this month by launching its factory at the 357-hectare Royal Group Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone labelled the Kingdom as one that can play an important role for Thailand-Plus-One.\n",

The company is looking to recruit between 1,000 and 1,500 Cambodian workers by 2023 to expand its production in the special economic zone on 357 hectares of land along National Road 4.Since starting its first operations in the special economic zone in April 2012, Sumi (Cambodia) Wiring Systems has 4,500 Cambodian workers now. At the beginning of this month, the company officially launched its operation in the new built-to-suit rental factory.Kenichi Urushibata, Chief Executive Officer of Sumitomo Wiring Systems, said the automobile industry is now facing a “once in a century” drastic transformation, requiring it to develop technologies in new fields such as electrification, automatic driving, connectivity and sharing.“By anticipating new trends and based on the technology for connecting and connected that we have developed in the automobile wiring harness business, we will continue to promote development of new products and technologies from the viewpoint of our customers,” Kenichi said.“We will continue to combine the Group’s strengths in moving ahead together and remaining connected over the next 100 years.

Prior to the onset of Covid-19, Cambodia was powering ahead with an average growth rate of 7 percent for about two decades. As the country emerges from Covid-19 pandemic following a successful vaccination campaign, a return to high levels of growth is anticipated. In particular, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest free trade agreement is expected to unleash significant upsides.”Businesspeople from Singapore, which is among Cambodia’s top five foreign investors, have established their presence in real estate, energy, training and distribution, retail, education and finance in the Kingdom.She also pointed out that Cambodia, which is situated at the heart of Southeast Asia Cambodia, has some key attributes as an investment destination.“It has an expanding middle-income population. Between 2015 and 2020 consumer spending has increased at an annual average of 6.5 percent year-on-year, opening doors for new products to enter the market,” the ambassador mentioned.She also lauded the growing digital economy fuelled by the young population in the Kingdom, suggesting that Cambodia has one of the highest mobile penetration rates in the world.While talking about the other attractions of the country as an investment destination, Ms Teo said, “It has an investment friendly environment which includes attractive tax incentives and 100 percent foreign ownership.

      "LONDON (AFP) – Around 40,000 British railway workers staged a walkout on Wednesday, a month after the largest strike in 30 years as the UK battles its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades.The nationwide walkout over pay and conditions brought the rail network to a virtual standstill with only one in five training running and caused major disruption to rush-hour commuters as many simply stayed at home.With inflation at a 40-year high and set to worsen, the cost-of-living crisis presents a major challenge to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former finance minister Rishi Sunak, who are vying to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a leadership contest.London Underground trains and buses ran as normal, but Eurostar reduced the number of trains though the Channel Tunnel as a knock-on effect, despite its staff not joining the walkout.Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, argues strikes are necessary as wages have failed to keep pace with UK inflation, currently at 9.4 percent and on course to keep rising.“Network Rail have not made any improvement on their previous pay offer and the train companies have not offered us anything new,” he said.Wednesday’s 24-hour strike comes after RMT staged a three-day walkout last month, also virtually paralysing the rail network.“The government need to stop their interference in this dispute so the rail employers can come to a negotiated settlement with us,” said Lynch.The government urged union bosses and train operators to resolve the dispute.“They don’t need to speak to ministers to resolve this because their employers are the people who have the mandate to negotiate this,” Transport Minister Grant Shapps told Sky News.“This is just… trying to distract attention,” he added. Services are expected to resume early Thursday.\n",

      "AFP – Stocks fell Wednesday as recession fears returned to the forefront of traders’ minds ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike later in the day.The selling followed a steep drop on Wall Street fuelled by concerns that four-decade high inflation and rising borrowing costs were keeping Americans from spending, and pushing the economy towards a recession.That was backed up by a profit warning by retail titan Walman and a closely watched consumer confidence gauge sinking for the third month in a row.And the International Monetary Fund slashed its global growth forecasts, warning the US economy would likely shrink.There had been hope that a recent rally across markets indicated the long-running sell-off may have come to an end, and that signs of an economic slowdown could allow the Fed to ease off its tightening by next year and start cutting rates in 2023.But observers warned there was still a lot of volatility to come as the bank was still hiking, prices were soaring, Russia’s war in Ukraine showed no sign of ending and China was still battling Covid with lockdowns.“The Fed hasn’t even gotten to neutral yet,” Jason England, of Janus Henderson Investors, told Bloomberg Television.“For them to start easing already or for them to start seeing eases priced it is, I think, a little premature.”All eyes are now on the Fed meeting, which concludes Wednesday and is followed Thursday by second-quarter economic growth figures.While officials are widely tipped to announce a second successive three-quarter point increase, the main focus will be their outlook for the economy and clues about future moves as it begins to falter.“Markets are pricing at a slower pace of tightening before the Fed pivots to an easing stance in 2023,” said SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes.“However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pushing back against a recession outcome while highlighting an outsized focus on combating inflation.”After a drop on Wall Street, most of Asia gave back a large chunk of Tuesday’s rally.Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta were all in the red, though Tokyo, Jakarta and Wellington eked out gains.But US futures rallied after healthy earnings releases from tech titans, including Microsoft and Alphabet, soothed some worries about the consumer.Oil prices fluctuated as recession worries were offset by data showing a big drop in US stockpiles, which pointed to strong demand at a time when supplies remain weak. \n",

      "AFP – Microsoft on Tuesday said that its earnings in the recently ended quarter fell shy of expectations as personal computer sales suffered from production holdups in China and sagging demand.The US technology giant reported a profit of $16.7 billion on revenue of $51.9 billion, topping the same quarter a year earlier but missing market forecasts.The earnings stumble was due mostly to foreign exchange rates and shutdowns of personal computer factories in China, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors.Microsoft said that the strong US dollar made its offerings more costly in foreign markets, hurting sales.“The most important core business; cloud and commercial bookings was relatively rock solid despite fears,” Ives said.“The core DNA of the Microsoft growth story is cloud and core Azure growth which was healthy this quarter and appears to have momentum into 2023 despite economic headwinds.”Microsoft shares were up some 4 percent in after-market trades that followed the release of the earnings figures.“In a dynamic environment we saw strong demand, took a share, and increased customer commitment to our cloud platform,” said Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood.Shutdowns at computer production facilities in China in May, and a deteriorating market for personal computers, cost Microsoft some $300 million in revenue it would have made from Windows operating systems bought to power the machines, the earnings report indicated.The personal computer market had been in steady decline prior to the pandemic, as people turned to smartphones or tablets.A massive shift to shopping, working, socializing and playing from home reignited demand for desktop computing power, but it remains to be seen whether that appetite will remain post-pandemic.Ad revenue at Microsoft’s online news, search, and career social network LinkedIn suffered due to companies cutting marketing budgets due to broad economic woes, the company said.The tech veteran based in the US state of Washington also logged $126 million in operating expenses related to scaling back its operations in Russia because of that country’s invasion of Ukraine.Microsoft saw consumers spend less on Xbox videogame content in the quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, in a possible sign that many are out playing in the real world more as pandemic restrictions ease.However, Microsoft’s cloud, business and productivity offerings continued to thrive.“We see real opportunity to help every customer in every industry use digital technology to overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger,” said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. \n",

      "Credit Guarantee Corporation of Cambodia (CGCC) has issued 515 letters of guarantee for loans worth $50.5 million by the end of June this year since the launch of the credit guarantee scheme in March 2021, according to the CGCC quarterly newsletter.The report showed that the loans were guaranteed under the business recovery guarantee scheme, co-financing guarantee scheme and women entrepreneur guarantee scheme. The state-owned firm guaranteed $28.9 million loans in the first half of this year — an increase of over 130 percent compared to 2021.Wong Keet Loong, CEO of CGCC, said that the scheme for the second quarter of this year showed a growth in both guaranteed value and number of letters of guarantee issued compared to the first quarter — increasing to $18.4 million from $10.3 million and to 189 letters of guarantee from 128.“We are confident that the momentum will continue into the second half of the year. We will continue to support participating financial institutions who can reach out to more entrepreneurs,” said Wong.In May of 2022 alone, $7.4 million loans were guaranteed for 71 businesses, according to the report, adding that this is the highest value of guarantees since April 2021. Of this, 412 letters of guarantee were for fixed-term loans.According to the report, about 400 entrepreneurs used the loans as working capital and about 96 percent or 498 businesses availed an average of $100,000 each for the purpose.About 75 percent, or 386 entrepreneurs, applied for the CGCC service without collaterals, the report pointed out, noting that the number of women entrepreneurs increased to 165 — availing 32 percent of the total loan — in June from 138 in May this year.Entrepreneurs in Phnom Penh received 156 letters of guarantee, accounting for about 30 percent, followed by those in Battambang with 56, Kampong Cham with 34 and Kampong Thom and Siem Reap, 30 each.“The coverage of credit guarantee grew nationwide through the networks and branches of the participating financial institutions. However, some remote provinces still need more promotion to raise awareness of the scheme,” the report said.In the April-June period this year, Canadia Bank, Sathapana Bank and LOLC Microfinance Institution applied for most loan guarantees under the scheme which is operated with the technical and financial guidance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.Raymond Sia, CEO of Canadia Bank, said the commercial bank has provided nearly $20 million to over 200 customers under the scheme.Canadia Bank has plans to provide more CGCC-guaranteed loans to both existing and new customers having good credit records and clear plan of loan usage.“We believe that the credit guarantee schemes can help potential business owners who are in need of loans but do not have sufficient collaterals, especially for the recovery and expansion of businesses after the pandemic,” he said.Wong had discussed issues such financial inclusion, financial literacy and risk weightage for guaranteed loans with the Director General of National Bank of Cambodia, Chea Serey, last month during a meeting attended by officials from both the institutions.\n",

      "Cambodia pins hope on more Singapore investment\n",
      "July 27, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119958/cambodia-pins-hope-on-more-singapore-investment/\n",
      "Cambodia urged more investment from Singapore businesspeople, pointing out the advantages of its newly introduced investment law.More sectors are eligible for incentives under the new investment law, Sok Chenda Sophea, Minister attached to the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) said while delivering his keynote address at a webinar organised by the Singapore Business Federation yesterday.Explaining the salient features of the law in the webinar titled ‘Discovering Cambodia – Insight Into The Business Opportunities in Cambodia’, Sophea said, “Cambodia has recently adopted a new law on investment. In 1994, we had adopted the law on investment and that law at that time was already very liberal. As per that law, all sectors were open, national treatment has been provided for all investors including foreign investors, and free repatriation. But the good news with the new law and acts since last October 2021 is that more sectors are eligible for incentives.”The Kingdom promulgated the new law on investment, known as the Law on Investment in the Kingdom of Cambodia, aimed at modernising the investment scenario in the country. The new initiatives boosted the economy that was adversely affected by Covid-19.Urging the investors and businesspeople from Singapore to look into the various business-friendly features of the new law, he said, “The law has 42 articles. When businesspeople look into the law, they can look at some chapters that mention the incentives. Look at chapter six, articles 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. Those articles are dealing with fiscal incentives. Article 24 enumerates 19 sectors or activities eligible for incentives. The previous law mentioned a certain number of activities already. But what is new is for the first time SMEs, not all but some, are eligible for incentives. And I think that this should be music to some Singaporean ears.”“In the previous law, we had a set of incentives, tax holidays, duty-free exemptions on the import of raw materials, and equipment machinery. But in the new law, article 26 will tell you that your project provided that you fulfil all conditions will be eligible for basic incentives. Basically, the tax holiday depends on the sector of activities.”He also explained the attractions of article 27, suggesting that the new initiatives would help attract more investment to the country.“Article 27 is brand new and it wasn’t there in the previous law. It’s about additional incentives. On top of the basic incentives, you will receive additional incentives,” he said.Sophea went on to explain that article 28 is about special incentives. Special incentives in the law precisely mentioned which activities in the sectors are considered of high priority, he pointed out.Sok Khoeun, Cambodia’s Ambassador to Singapore; Teo Lay Cheng, Singapore’s Ambassador to Cambodia; David Totten, Managing Director, Emerging Markets Consulting; Han Peng Kwang, CEO, Wing Bank Cambodia; and Richard Seah, Commercial Director, Lim Siang Huat have talked about the investment opportunities being offered by the Kingdom.According to the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), it is the apex business chamber championing the interests of the Singapore business community in the areas of trade, investment and industrial relations. It represents 27,000 companies, as well as key local and foreign business chambers.SBF said it was established on 1 April 2002, with the aim of representing the business community’s interests both locally and overseas. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119960/adb-de-heus-sign-15m-agriculture-loan-deal/\n",
      "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday signed a $15 million loan agreement with animal feed producer De Heus TMH Company Limited (DH-TMH) to foster the development of agricultural feed industry in Cambodia, according to a press release.The deal that was signed at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries would allow DH-TMH to increase efficiency in feed production by expanding its storage and processing capacity of animal feed production in Kampong Speu province, the press release said.“This will allow the company to buy more local raw materials like maize, rice and cassava from small-scale farmers within its supply chain, enabling a supply of affordable, high-quality feed for livestock and fish farmers,” the release points out.DH-TMH is a joint venture between De Heus Animal Nutrition from the Netherlands, a family-owned global animal feed supplier established in 1911, and TMH Company Limited from Cambodia.“With investments in storage, maize can be stored for more extended periods, making the supply chain less dependent on climate-related vulnerability,” it said.ADB Country Director for Cambodia Jyotsana Varma said the deal would allow the multilateral development partner to support DH-TMH by helping to strengthen the feed value chain, improve livelihoods of feed crop, livestock, and fish farmers, and support sustainable and resilient agricultural practices.“Developing locally sourced, high-quality, and affordable animal feed supply is integral in safeguarding Cambodia’s food security and reducing reliance on imported feed inputs,” she said.Gabor Fluit, CEO of De Heus in Asia, said De Heus TMH is committed to empowering independent farmers in Cambodia. DH-TMH is a leading animal feed producer in Cambodia, with the capacity to produce 180,000 metric tons of high-quality livestock feed.“The strategic cooperation agreement … in combination with our focus on training and knowledge sharing, with the motto ‘global knowledge—local impact’, will support and accelerate the sustainable development of the Cambodian animal protein supply chain,” Gabor said.Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Veng Sakhon, who also attended the signing ceremony, said the financing deal is expected to improve the value chain of feed production in terms of quantity, quality, safety and competitiveness in the domestic and overseas markets.A technical assistance grant will support training for 2,000 maize and 2,000 poultry farmers, many of them women, in climate-resilient farm practices and financial literacy. Supporting women farmers will help strengthen their positions within farms and boost their access to finance to expand their businesses.The transaction will be supported by the Asian Development Fund 13 Private Sector Window (PSW) through a partial guarantee solution. The PSW supports private sector development in frontier markets by offering grant resources to fund financial products that address and reduce common financing constraints that hinder many private sector transactions.ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members, 49 from the region.\n",

      "The Agro-Food and Tourism Enterprise Recovery Programme (AFTER) implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) benefitted 60 enterprises and private communities from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) hit by Covid-19.According to a report by the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, the achievements of the AFTER programmes also include direct capacity-building support to at least 462 employees and employers from the agro-food and tourism sectors through awareness of the standard operating procedures (SOPs).The project was developed under the Strategic Development Plan for Cambodian Agro-industries (2019-2030).It also successfully supported the development and implementation of rehabilitation plans for these sectors through interventions based on the specific needs of individual enterprises and communities.The project was launched about two years ago to support Cambodia’s agro-food and tourism MSMEs hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. It aimed to increase the resilience of the MSMEs in the country, considering the important contribution of the sector to the economy, especially in the creation of jobs.At the closing ceremony of AFTER, Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation Cham Prasidh said that Covid-19 pandemic has severely affected global public health, international trade and investment, besides the global supply chain.The epidemic has also affected the key economic sectors, such as garments, tourism, and food production and construction, which are the key pillars of Cambodia’s economic growth. MSMEs run by women were the worst hit.In its response to Covid-19, the government had put in place a number of measures to support businesses, including tax cuts or tax delays, reduction of rent for small and medium enterprises, reduction of tariffs for electricity, gas and logistics in some sectors such as industry, agriculture, trade, and services besides unemployment insurance payments to enterprises that did not lay off employees. \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119596/bri-plays-monumental-role-in-cambodian-infrastructure/\n",
      "The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects have played a “monumental role” in infrastructure development and connectivity in Cambodia, said the country’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn.In a recent written interview with Chinese media, Sokhonn said massive infrastructure projects including roads, bridges, seaports, airports, railways, hydropower dams and communication satellites, among others, are already underway in Cambodia, and these projects are all top priorities for economic development.He added that there have been big projects from the cooperation between Cambodia and China under the China-proposed BRI, including the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville expressway and the new Siem Reap international airport.“Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone is a testament to the fruitful cooperation between the two countries under the BRI while the expressway and the airport will contribute to further boosting the economy,” he said.He said the BRI has also stimulated the promotion of cooperation in several fields such as institutional capacity building, knowledge sharing and human resources development as China provides help through scholarships, fellowships and research centers.“More resources in innovation and green technology are needed as green development has become the key feature of BRI projects,” Sokhonn said.“With this connection, I believe that the BRI will significantly contribute to the realization of Cambodia’s development goals of becoming an upper and middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income society by 2050,” he added.On Cambodia-China ties, Sokhonn said bilateral relations have stood the test of time, and with constant nurturing by leaders of the two countries in different generations, bilateral ties have been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and have kept growing from strength to strength.“The two countries have enjoyed fruitful cooperation and tangible benefits,” he said.He added that Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen reiterated the fact that Cambodia’s development in all fields can not be detached from China’s support and assistance.“China remains Cambodia’s largest trading partner and has become Cambodia’s important export destination,” Sokhonn said.He said China has been Cambodia’s largest source of foreign direct investment, the largest provider of development assistance and an important source of tourists.Thanks to China’s vaccine assistance, Cambodia has successfully fought the COVID-19 pandemic, he said, adding that such assistance has played a significant role in bolstering Cambodia’s economic recovery amid the pandemic.As for BRICS, the acronym for an emerging-market group that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, Sokhonn said that such a group has played a more important role in accelerating global socioeconomic recovery in a pandemic-ravaged era.As the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for 2022, Cambodia hopes that ASEAN and BRICS, as well as the international community as a whole, will make more efforts to support multilateralism that prioritizes convergences in tackling regional and global challenges, particularly the pandemic as well as food and energy security, he said.Commenting on the group’s future expansion, Sokhonn said that it will enable BRICS to better represent voices of growing economies and allow the group to be more responsive to existing and emerging challenges.It also allows developing countries to have a new platform based on the spirit of openness, mutual benefits and win-win cooperation in order to exchange views and best practices and achieve socioeconomic development, he said.  China Daily\n",

      "The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries will conduct technical training on Good Agriculture Practices for longan and mango farmers on the required standard for exports.The Battambang provincial department of Agriculture said in a statement yesterday that those who wish to export the commodities abroad shall register for technical training.Chhim Vichara, director of the provincial agricultural department, said, “The training is to ensure appropriate standards and technical conditions for exports, especially to China.”Passing through the GAP training, farmers can register their farm for assessment inspection by officials to be eligible for exports, he said.“For those who have already received training shall apply for the evaluation to get the certificate of Good Agricultural Practice – Cambodia and evaluation inspection to plantations for export, which is a requirement for exports, especially to China,” he said.The move comes ahead of the first shipment of Palin longan to China, scheduled to be in September.Ngin Chhay, director-general of the agriculture ministry, said last week that the shipment of Palin longan to China would be expected in September this year, calling farmers to strengthen their farming by following sanitary and phytosanitary measures.Last week, China Jinan Engineering Import Export (Cambodia) Co Ltd signed another MoU with Pailin longan communities in four provinces including Pailin, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Pursat provinces to export the produce from September 2022 to June 2023.A group of farmers in Pailin province in June reached a deal to export longan fruits directly to China.The fruits will be put through the sanitizing process at the factory and packaged before transport in cooling containers.\n",

      "The Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) have jointly pushed for the issuance of green, social and sustainable bonds in the capital market of the country under Asean standards.The issuance of green, social and sustainable bonds would provide private firms with tax incentives and enhancement of their brands. The companies can showcase that they have the commitment to curb global climate change to help secure the welfare and well-being of future generations, a SERC official said.Sou Socheat, Director General of SERC, said the regulator has actively been working with ADB to promote the issuance of green, social and sustainable bonds in the Kingdom.“We have many potential green bond issuers in our economy. I hope to see more local and foreign investors investing in green, social and sustainable bonds in Cambodia and throughout the region,” Socheat said, adding that SERC has issued green bond issuance guidelines in the Khmer language.Socheat said last Friday during a workshop on ‘The Implication of the Development of Sustainable Capital Market in Asean to the Development of Sustainable Bond Market in Cambodia’ in Siem Reap province that SERC has also encouraged underwriters, financial advisors and potential issuers to join the journey of developing the market.He added that the regulator is also the co-chair of the Asean Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) which is a high-level group of capital market regulators from all 10 Asean jurisdictions.Jyotsana Varma, Country Director of Cambodia Resident Mission of ADB, said that Cambodia is still at an early stage of capital market development, and green, social and sustainable bonds under the ASEAN standards have not yet been issued.“We believe that the Cambodian capital market is ready to play a larger role in facilitating the mobilisation of private capital for sustainable investments that can contribute to Cambodia’s transition to a more resilient future,” said Varma.ADB and SERC have been collaborating closely to create an enabling ecosystem to support the development of a sustainable finance market in the Kingdom, she said, adding that the Khmer version of the green bond issuance handbook helps bond issuers and advisors understand the process and key considerations for successful green bond issuance.“We hope that this handbook will be useful for Cambodian corporates looking to raise funds through the capital market to support their sustainability initiatives,” she said.Under the ACMF, the ASEAN green, social and Sustainability bond standards were introduced in 2017 and to date, a total of $25.07 billion of Asean-labelled GSS Bonds have been issued.“These admirable achievements have validated the importance of a sustainable bond market which helps mobilise valuable resources for projects that can make significant development impacts in the region,” she said.Thanks to these bonds, more renewable energy projects can be financed, bringing electricity to more households and businesses, more women-led entrepreneurs can have better access to finance, and more affordable schools, hospitals, and houses can be built to provide better access to the poor and the vulnerable, she added.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119356/insurance-payouts-rose-to-41-3-million-in-2021/\n",
      "The insurance payouts in Cambodia rose 11.3 percent to $41.3 million in 2021, compared to the payouts in the previous year, according to the data from the Insurance Association of Cambodia (IAC)At the opening ceremony of the 2022 Insurance Day yesterday, Huy Vatharo, Chairman of the IAC, said that the total amount of reimbursement for the general insurance market was approximately $29.8 million. The health insurance payout was approximately 34.9 percent, followed by vehicle insurance at 22.1 percent and property insurance at 21.5 percent. The total amount of compensation paid for life insurance was $10.7 million, of which the risk of death accounted for 77.6 percent of the total life insurance payout, the report said.The total amount of compensation paid for the micro-insurance market is $0.8 million and out of which the majority are for micro-life insurance compensation comprising 53 percent, motor insurance compensation of 22.5 percent and small micro-health insurance compensation of 16.7 percent.He said, “Given the amount of insurance payout, it can be assessed that the protection gap in Cambodia is very large. The financial, family and social security in Cambodia are not yet fully protected by insurance services due to the limited use of insurance, which is partly due to the lack of awareness of the people. The Cambodia Insurance Day 2022 will not only provide the public with a better understanding of the insurance market but also contribute to increasing public awareness of the insurance benefits.”Bou Chanpirou, Director General of Insurance Regulator of Cambodia, said that public awareness of insurance services and the benefits of insurance is a key factor in driving the growth of comprehensive use of insurance services.He said, “The Cambodian insurance market has been growing rapidly by about 20 percent in the last five years, with the gross insurance premium market size reaching about $300 million by 2021. Despite the global crisis of Covid-19, the Cambodian insurance market continues to grow by about 10 percent compared to 2020. However, the insurance penetration rate in the Cambodian economy is 1.11 percent and the use of insurance as a premium density is only $18.75 per person.”\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119423/cambodias-top-e-learning-platform-eyes-asean-stage/\n",
      "Prof Lun Borey, co-founder of E-School Cambodia, the country’s leading digital learning platform with more than one million subscribers, said recently that the company is eyeing Asean as the next stage for its expansion.While making a presentation at the online event ‘35 Minutes on Business,’ organised by the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) recently for the benefit of upcoming young entrepreneurs, Prof Borey said that a strong social commitment along with faith in the future of digitization has helped him succeed with the venture.Prof Borey’s idea of success is simple. “You got to love what you do and believe in what you do, success will follow,” he said.Prof Borey remembered that while launching the venture as a co-founder in 2017, the only thing he wanted was to provide the best e-learning application for students and he had the ample support of the Ministry of Youth, Education and Sports in this.“Making a profit was not a criterion. And, Covid-19 was still more than two years away then. We went ahead with the vision of ‘one country, one digital school’,” he remembered.Prof Borey, however, said that Covid-19 led to his company adding subscribers in large numbers. “But our motto was never to replace classroom education with online studies. We wanted to supplement classroom learning with the online app. Learn ‘Anywhere Any Time’ was what we offered,” he said.Prof Borey reminded the upcoming entrepreneurs that they need to keep their fundamentals strong before launching a venture. In the case of E-School Cambodia, it was the expertise of the educators. “We had a strong team. I myself got the necessary experience from Japan. We ensured that we create the best e-learning platform for the country and this brought us the award for the best innovation app of 2021 from the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications,” he said.Prof Borey also reminded the budding entrepreneurs that starting a business is one thing and sustaining it is a different thing. “Your commitment to the cause counts here the most,” he said.The E-School Cambodia now employs over 100 people and has to his credit over 20,000 educational videos. Students up to grade 12 can access the online lessons from top professors at any time and from anywhere. The company is also now looking for potential investors for its Asean ambitions.Meanwhile, Hong Sok Hour, Royal Government Delegate in charge as CEO of the CSX, also shared the successful business story of Duolingo, which is an American educational technology company producing language-learning apps.The company, founded in 2011 raised funds in several stages to the tune of $183.8 million and also publicly sold shares worth approximately $521 million ($102 per share). Recently, the company was valued around $3.74 billion.The purpose of sharing this story was to motivate and inspire local business owners to consider using the idle capital of others to quickly expand and strengthen their business ventures.The ‘35 Minutes on Business’ is organised regularly to support small and medium enterprises, as well as potential start-ups. It allows business owners to share their experiences of successes and failures, and encourages members of the public who want to start their own businesses to get ahead with their dreams.\n",

      "The Social Performance Task Force (SPTF) and the Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA) have signed a new memorandum of understanding to strengthen financial stability and customer protection in Cambodia.SPTF and CMA signed the agreement on Friday in Phnom Penh along with senior management officials from the National Bank of Cambodia. Other stakeholders around the world joined the event virtually.“This new partnership, a first of its kind, will help chart a roadmap for responsible growth, financial stability and customer protection in Cambodia’s microfinance and broader financial sector,” said Nitin Madan, the SPTF Director of Responsible Inclusive Finance Facility for Southeast Asia (RIFF-SEA).“The CMA and its members can also apply for co-financing for implementing and strengthening capacity on responsible, inclusive finance practices of financial service providers in Southeast Asia,” he said.The Cambodia Microfinance Association is a nonprofit sector association with more than 120 member organizations, which was established to ensure that Cambodians receive formal financial services in a timely and sustainable manner.The CMA works with microfinance institutions, banks, financial leasing institutions and rural credit institutions which also engages with regulators, national and international donors, creditors, investors and other stakeholders.The recently adopted banking and financial sector Code of Conduct led by CMA promotes the adoption of international best practices in Cambodia to reiterate the commitment of financial institutions to clients and promote a healthy reputation of the sector.“This partnership aims to strengthen responsible inclusive practices from a risk management perspective to promote responsible growth, enhance financial stability and increase consumer protection.The initiative also comes in the context of Smart Campaign phasing out, leading to the SPTF-CERISE partnership to play a more active role in that space. To this end, the partnership will also work toward the promotion and adoption of the SPTF-CERISE Client Protection Pathway and Certification on client protection,” said CMA chairman Sok Voeun.SPTF and CMA will focus on helping financial institutions in Cambodia learn about the SPTF’s Client Protection Pathway and the Universal Standards for Social & Environmental Performance Management. Increasing client protection is a priority under Cambodia’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy for long-term market sustainability.“Building trust in formal financial services remains crucial to increase financial inclusion in Cambodia and ensure the stability of the whole banking system while customer protection is the priority for all stakeholders,” said Kith Sovannarith, the First Deputy Director of Bank Supervision with the National Bank of Cambodia.“Since SPTF was founded in 2005, we have seen the power of collective action to drive effective self-governance. In many geographically and culturally diverse countries, the financial markets are healthier, and clients are protected, when providers come together to agree to codes of conduct and performance standards to which they will hold themselves and each other accountable,” said Laura Foose, Executive Director of SPTF.SPTF’s work in Cambodia is made possible through the generous support of the Government of Luxembourg through the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, which funds the RIFF-SEA. SPTF’s work with CMA on the Code of Conduct also reflects the globally renowned Client Protection Pathway, for which generous funding has been provided by the Agence Française de Dévelopement.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119417/india-major-contributor-as-singapore-visitor-arrivals-increase-12-fold/\n",
      "ANI – The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) predicted in a statement that it expects international visitor arrivals to the city-state to reach as much as six million this year.With the country reopening its borders in April to all vaccinated travellers, it received more than 1.5 million visitors for the first half of 2022.While still very much shy of the 9.3 million tourists that come into Singapore during the first six months of pre-COVID 2019, it is 12 times more than it received for the corresponding period in 2021.Of the 1.5 million visitors, Indians represent the second highest nationality coming to Singapore during this six-month period with over 219,000 visiting the island.The largest group of visitors is from neighbours Indonesia at 282,000. Malaysia is third with 139,000 visiting Singapore by air, followed by Australia (125,000) and the Philippines (81,000). Together the top five account for over 56 per cent of international visitors for the January to June period of this year.With much of the world’s population now vaccinated and with global travel picking up, Singapore is receiving a significant share of visitor traffic.This is because it was one of the first in the region to reopen its borders with no quarantine and is also perceived to be a safe destination having seen to have handled the coronavirus outbreak well.In terms of absolute year-on-year visitor growth, visitor arrivals from Indonesia expanded 1,996 per cent, India 1,344 per cent and Malaysia 2,000 per cent.This year, 84 per cent of the 1.5 million visitors who arrived in the first six months came to Singapore after the border reopened to all vaccinated travellers in April.For comparison, Singapore received 330,000 foreign visitors in the first six months of 2021, and in the same period of 2020, it received 2.74 million travellers, out of which 88 per cent arrived in the pre-pandemic lockdown months of January and February that year.With the number of visitors to Singapore rising rapidly, Singapore’s Changi Airport has been kept busy.Last week, the airport announced that it will reopen Terminal 4 from September 13 this year, the last of the terminals not yet operating after COVID-19 all but shut down the airport.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119420/amid-detente-somalia-kenya-restart-lucrative-khat-trade/\n",
      "Anadulo Agency – The multimillion-dollar khat trade between Somalia and Kenya resumed on Sunday after a break of over two years, a sign of thawing tensions between the East African neighbours.Cargo planes carrying tons of khat (locally known as miraa) landed at the Aden Adde airport in the Somali capital Mogadishu.The khat trade, which generates millions of dollars every month, was one of the victims of a growing tiff between Somalia and Kenya.In December 2020, Mogadishu cut off diplomatic relations with Nairobi, accusing it of violating Somali sovereignty and territorial integrity.The neighbours have also been embroiled in a dispute over maritime territory with potential oil and gas deposits.Last October, the UN’s top court ruled largely in Somalia’s favour, but Kenya rejected the verdict and accused the International Court of Justice of bias.However, Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who came to power in May, visited Nairobi earlier this month, where he signed deals with his counterpart Uhuru Kenyatta on trade and aviation.The agreements and detente have been welcomed in the wider Horn of Africa region, while the two countries have also agreed to work together as an ongoing devastating drought threatens millions of their people.During the Nairobi meetings, Mohamud and Kenyatta also agreed to coordinate in the “fight against terrorism,” with both struggling to eliminate al-Shabaab, a terror group affiliated with the al-Qaeda terrorist organization.Mostly used in northeast Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and by expatriate communities from these regions, khat is a leafy green plant containing two main stimulant drugs which speed up the mind and body.Thousands of farmers were left without a market for their khat, especially in central Kenya, with the ban on export. They were forced to sell their produce locally at low prices. Thousands of people dealing in khat, including packers, transporters and traders, lost their jobs due to the ban.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501119422/russia-how-is-worlds-most-sanctioned-economy-doing/\n",
      "Moscow faring better than expected as it still has ways to earn, pinch of sanctions likely in near future, says expertAnadulo Agency – Six months into the Ukraine war, the world’s most sanctioned country, Russia, seems relatively comfortable surfing the tidal wave of Western sanctions aimed at swamping its economy.That is the case at least for now, with the full impact of the sanctions and their “moving targets” expected to be fully felt by Moscow over the coming months. For now, though, many are asking: Just how sustainable is the resilience displayed so far by the Russian economy?The Russian Central Bank is projecting a 4 percent-6 percent recession in 2022, a volte-face from its pre-war forecast of 3 percent growth.The figure, however, is much better compared to the earlier prediction of an 8 percent-10 percent contraction this year. Russia has slashed its key rate by 150 basis points to 8 percent, well above market forecasts of a reduction of 50 basis points, pushing interest rates below the pre-war level to boost domestic demand.‘Economic downturn possibly less deep’“Incoming data indicates that the economic downturn will be more prolonged in time and possibly less deep,” Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Russian Central Bank, told reporters in Moscow after last Friday’s rate decision.The bank expects the economy to return to growth by 2024.In June, Russia’s annual inflation declined to 15.9 percent from 17.1 percent in May, seemingly in line with the Central Bank’s latest estimate of an annual inflation rate of 12-15 percent in 2022, a downward revision from the April forecast of 18 -23 percent.The economy is obviously backed by fiscal stimuli and a soaring price of oil that has helped it weather the impact of sanctions.Russia has run a huge current account surplus due to import bans, accelerating the de-dollarisation of its economy and driving the appreciation of the ruble.With strict capital controls and trade imbalances, the ruble was at 58 against the dollar in late July, well above pre-war levels and the all-time low of 150 touched in March.The consumer confidence index, however, plummeted to minus 31 in the second quarter, the lowest point since 2014. The fall came after it plunged to minus 21 in the first quarter, the lowest reading since 2009.Russia’s automotive sector has also taken a big hit from the import ban, with new car sales sliding by 82 percent year-on-year to 27,761 units in June.‘Russian economy not near collapse’While sanctions have definitely hurt the Russian economy, the damage is not serious enough for Moscow to consider leaving Ukraine, let alone worry about a possible economic collapse, according to Kerim Can Kavakli, an academic at the Bocconi University in Italy.“I don’t believe the Russian economy is near collapse,” he told Anadolu Agency. For one, he explained, Russia continues to make money from international trade, as major economies such as China, India, and Saudi Arabia have not joined the West’s push for sanctions.“Russia is able to find new buyers for its oil and gas, and the rise in oil prices has helped it further. Russia continues to earn money from trade,” he said.Another factor is that there are definitely more sanctions in the offing against Russia.Germany, one of the biggest buyers of Moscow’s coal, has pledged to end imports of Russian coal by August 1 and oil by December 31.Last month, G7 countries announced plans to ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Moscow, while the EU will follow suit.\n",

During April of last year, the General Department of Customs of China approved mango imports from 37 plantations and five packaging facility.However, due to Covid-19, exports from Cambodia have faced challenges according the Ministry of Agriculture. In the first five months of 2022, the export of some fresh agricultural products of Cambodia to international markets, especially China, has declined significantly due to a number of factors, such as tightening controls on goods to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Under the recent Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, the assessment of phytosanitary requirements for the export of fresh longan fruit from Cambodia to China has reached the final stage.

      "The Cambodian government has decided to confiscate the right of conducting a feasibility study on the Phnom Penh-Bavet Expressway project from China Railway International Group Co Ltd (CRIG).The China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is commissioned to conduct the study now, according to a senior official of the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MPWT).The decision was made on Saturday following the failure of CRIG to complete the study after three years. The company had a shortage of technicians for the study even though the government allowed an extension of three months to complete the study in April, the official said.Kong Vimean, the spokesman of PMWT, told Khmer Times yesterday that CRBC was selected to conduct the study as the Chinese firm had successfully implemented the $2 billion Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway.“The previous company had not been able to do the job as it lacks technicians. So, the government has decided to confiscate its license and award it to the new company,” said Vimean.Vimean, who is also the undersecretary of state and director of cabinet of PMWT, added that CRBC is expected to complete the study by the end of this year.“Even though the government already has some data, there have been some changes in terms of geography. While some locations have already been measured, new locations need to be measured and some places need to be re-aligned,” he said.The spokesman pointed out that the length of the expressway project would be changed to some extent. After the study is completed successfully, the government will negotiate the costs and other important points with CRBC before an agreement is signed.The Phnom Penh-Bavet Expressway is expected to be linked to Vietnam’s expressway in the connectivity master plan of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “We cannot delay this work as we need to boost trade faster,” Vimean said.The initial study showed that the length of the project is about 135 kilometres from Phnom Penh and spans Kandal, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng provinces to Bavet International Border.The project is also expected to improve logistics in the region from Phnom Penh to Bavet which connects Phnom Penh City and the Vietnam border, thereby contributing to the economic development of Cambodia and Greater Mekong Subregion, according to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Chea Chandara, president of Logistics and Supply Chain Business Association, told Khmer Times that Phnom Penh-Bavet Expressway Project could cost more than Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway as it will need to get through more small water channels.However, Chandara said the project would help improve the transportation of goods inflow — especially from China and Singapore that transit at Cai Mep International Terminal and Cap Lai Port in Ho Chi Minh City — to Cambodia. “This means truck transportation of goods would be done faster and some industries near the borders such as garment factories also need faster and larger ways to transport their goods,” Chandara said.    \n",

      "Cambodia attracted a fixed-asset investment of almost $3 billion in the first half of this year, reflecting the firm confidence of investors in the Kingdom’s growth prospects.The Council for the Development of Cambodia registered 98 projects with a total investment of $2.99 billion in January-June period of this year, inching up $29 million from the same period last year.Local investment projects with a total investment of $1.59 billion accounted for 53.23 percent of total investment, while foreign investment from China registered $1.29 billion, accounting for 43.02 percent, stated the CDC report.Other foreign investments in the kingdom for the first half of this year were from Thailand, Samoa, British Virgin Islands, South Korea, Singapore, Cayman Islands, Malaysia, Japan and Australia, it added.The increase in both investment projects and value reflected the confidence of investors in the Cambodian government after the country resumed its socio-economic activities following the improvement in the Covid-19 scenario, said Lim Heng, Vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.Heng also attributed the growth in the investment sector to stability, peace, and social security, particularly the successful Covid-19 control with a high rate of vaccinated population.“The resumption of social and economic activities attracted interest from both local and foreign investors to invest in the country,” Heng said yesterday.“Cambodia will be able to attract more investments because both local and foreign investors see the potential of trade preferences the country has such as RCEP, Cambodia-China FTA, Cambodia-Korea FTA and the implementation of the new investment law,” he added.Investment projects had been focused on agriculture and agro-industry sectors, manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure.The growth of investment reflected the government’s efforts to recover the economy from the pandemic, said Sok Chenda Sophea, Secretary-General of the Council for the Development of Cambodia.“This increase is not a coincidence, but due to the efforts of the government, which has won the battle against Covid-19 by using vaccines as a key strategic weapon, enabling Cambodia to resume its socio-economic development in all sectors from last November,” Sophea was quoted by Freshnews.Heng Sokkung, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, said that support of infrastructure and sufficient energy contributed to building confidence in investors in Cambodia.“The government has built and improved physical infrastructure to facilitate better transport, increase sufficient energy and clean water to ensure stable production chains. This has built firm confidence in investors to invest in Cambodia,” Sokkung said.The Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal were put into force in January this year.CCC’s Lim Heng said new trade preferences under the FTAs that the government has planned to establish with partner countries would give more boost in attracting new investment and export Cambodia-made products to wider markets.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501118469/japan-set-to-increase-concessional-loans-to-kingdom/\n",
      "The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is scheduled to increase its concessional loans twice each year for Cambodia.Hataeda Miko, head of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Division of JICA, said in a meeting with Cambodian finance minister Aun Pornmoniroth last week that the move is to support the development and additional cooperative financing in the country.Pornmoniroth said the Japanese government and people have provided official development assistance through JICA for the development of many sectors in Cambodia, especially physical infrastructures such as the international seaport, roads, bridges, electricity, irrigation, hospitals, schools and water treatment plants.“These activities reflect clearly that Japan is still a great friend and strategic development partner for Cambodia,” Pornmoniroth said, adding that the existing projects are expected to be consistent with socio-economic development sectors, policies and strategies of Cambodia’s strategic plans.“Both parties also discussed and shared experiences on some ongoing projects and upcoming projects in Japanese official development assistance loan,” a press release said.Pornmoniroth said in the meeting, also attended by Kamei Haruko — who is the chief representative of JICA Cambodia Office — that grant aids, concessional loans and technical assistance provided by the Japanese government have contributed to the implementation of strategic policies and strategies in all stages that Cambodian government has set out.“Obviously, in the current context, Cambodia has been striving to forward actively and continuously to achieve the objectives of its economic policies in order to attain upper middle-income status in 2030,” he said, adding that Japan’s official development assistance is vital for prioritised needs and key policies of the government.Haruko said Cambodia is located in a geopolitically strategic position, almost in the centre of Asean countries, sandwiched between Thailand and Vietnam, emerging economies in Asia, and is an important node of the Southern Economic Corridor that connects Asean countries by land.She added that at the same time, it faces Indo-Pacific sea lanes, to which the Government of Japan aims to foster regional stability and prosperity by improving connectivity between Asia and Africa through a “free and open Indo-Pacific vision.”\n",

      "The Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) helped attract more investment from China to Cambodia in the first half of this year.According to a report from the Council for the Development of Cambodia, Cambodia received a $1.29 billion fixed-asset investment from China in the first half of this year.China accounted for around 43 percent of the total investment of $2.99 billion dollars that the Kingdom received in the first six months of 2022, the report indicated.Some of the other countries that invested in Cambodia during the January-June period this year were Thailand, Samoa, British Virgin Islands, South Korea, Singapore, Cayman Islands, Malaysia, Japan and Australia.The main projects that attracted foreign investment include agriculture and agro-industry sectors, manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure.Heng Sokkung, secretary of state and spokesman for the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, was quoted as saying in an agency report that excellent ties, the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership were the main factors that helped attract more investors from China to the Kingdom.Both the CCFTA and the 15-member RCEP trade deal entered into force on January 1, 2022.“I believe that these free trade agreements, together with Cambodia’s favourable investment law, peace and political stability, have provided a great opportunity for foreign investors, particularly Chinese ones, to invest in Cambodia,” he was quoted as saying in the report.“Chinese investment has not only brought in new capital, but also advanced technologies for Cambodia’s socio-economic development,” he pointed out.Meanwhile, Lim Heng, vice president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, told the news agency that the ironclad friendship and the Belt and Road Initiative are also the major factors attracting more Chinese investors to the kingdom.“Chinese investment is essential to help boost Cambodia’s economy and create new jobs for Cambodian people in the post-Covid-19 pandemic era,” he said.Meanwhile, the trade volume between Cambodia and China surged 19.7 percent to $5.98 billion in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year, data from Cambodia’s General Department of Customs and Excise showed.Penn Sovicheat, undersecretary of state and spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, told the news agency that China is the largest trading partner of Cambodia. He said the bilateral trade growth will be higher in the coming months and years.“China is a huge market for Cambodia, especially for our potential agricultural products such as rice, bananas, mangoes and cassava, among others. Both the RCEP and the CCFTA have been giving a boost to our trade and investment growth,” he said.RCEP comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including ten Asean member states, namely Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n",

      "Commerce Minister Pan Sorasak examined red corn and Pailin longan produces at the four provinces near the Cambodia-Thailand border recently to study the feasibility of expanding the markets and adding value to the supply chains, a release said.The examination was undertaken at the cooperatives along with officials from the ministry and provincial departments of commerce, agriculture, forestry and fisheries and cooperatives in Pailin, Battambang and Banteay Meanchey provinces.“For the robust production of red corn, good agriculture practices have to be adopted. Sanitary and phytosanitary procedures are also required to ensure the quality of its exports in accordance with regional and international agreements,” Sorasak said.Farmers and cooperatives said they are facing challenges that include rising production costs and the high quality of export standards set for red corns and Pailin longan. They also do not have enough knowledge regarding the benefits of registering the plantations or about good agriculture practices.They added that they are also unaware of the sanitary and phytosanitary procedures even though agriculture officials have gone to the field to raise awareness about them.“Farmers and cooperatives have requested to the Commerce Ministry to coordinate with other ministries and relevant institutions to look into their requests and also standardize the truckload size that differs in Cambodia and Thailand,” the release said.They urged the commerce ministry to work for the expansion of both domestic and overseas markets, such as Thailand and China, so that farmers can raise production.The minister assured that the commerce ministry will look into the requests regarding the standardisation of loads for the trucks.“Regarding the inter-sector challenges, the Commerce Ministry will review the requests with other ministries and relevant institutions and provide proper responses to eliminate the problems that impeded the production and the export,”​ he said.Red corn holds great potential in both the domestic and overseas markets as livestock fodder, the release said, adding that it is currently planted in about 145,983 hectares in the country.Red corn is planted in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Pursat, Tboung Khmum, Kratie, Preah Vihear, Prey Veng and Kandal provinces and exported to Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Bangladesh.CP Cambodia Limited had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a red corn plantation cooperative in the Pailin province for procuring the produce, according to the release.China Jinan Engineering Import Export (Cambodia) Co Ltd had signed another MoU with Pailin longan communities in four provinces including Pailin, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Pursat provinces to export the produce from September 2022 to June 2023.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501118688/uk-foreign-secretary-lays-blame-for-travel-chaos-on-france/\n",
      "Anadulo Agency – The UK’s foreign secretary on Saturday blamed France for the travel chaos faced by many travelers and holidaymakers at the Port of Dover in southeast England.Liz Truss accused French authorities of not sending enough officials to man border posts and rejected French claims that Brexit was the cause of the chaos.“The fact is that the French authorities have not put enough people on the border and I am in touch with the French authorities, I am very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing,” Truss said in an interview with Sky News.When asked if the chaos faced at the port is a result of post-Brexit border checks, the foreign secretary said the current situation is the result of a lack of resources.“This is a situation that is being caused by a lack of resources at the border and that is what the French authorities need to address and that is what I am being very clear about,” Truss added.French authorities have rejected claims by the British government that it is at fault for the delays and logjams, arguing instead that Brexit and the erection of border checks are the cause for delays and obstruction.The UK’s official union for borders, the ISU, said Brexit had resulted in stringent checks at the country’s borders.“It’s certainly the case that the checks are more rigorous than they used to be. Prior to Brexit, there was a deemed right of entry. We weren’t in Schengen but there were still very minimal checks … and frequently there were no French checks at all,” ISU official Lucy Morton said.“We’re now, of course, outside the EU and they’re entitled to treat us as they treat any other European traveller. So they do the same level of checks we do, and have always done, on them,” Morton added.On Friday, the Port of Dover, a major terminal for travellers seeking entry into France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, declared a “critical incident” after travellers faced queues that lasted up to six hours.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501118695/iraq-kurdistan-choose-dialogue-to-ease-oil-dispute/\n",
      "AFP – The federal government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish region pledged Saturday to “increase dialogue” to ease a simmering oil dispute that has been playing out in the courts in recent months.The announcement came during a rare visit to the Iraqi capital by the Kurdish region’s prime minister. Masrour Barzani, who had not visited Baghdad since 2019, met Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi for wide-ranging talks.An oil dispute that has been poisoning relations between the two sides, and threatening to harm Iraq’s lifeline oil industry according to analysts, was among the topics.“It was agreed to increase dialogue between the federal ministry of oil and the ministry of natural resources in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to address the outstanding issues and continue working to reach common solutions,” a statement from Kadhemi’s office said.“The two sides… emphasised the need to strengthen cooperation and joint coordination between the federal government and the regional government to attract investments, and maximise revenues,” it added.The long-simmering dispute came to a head in February – at a time of political deadlock in Baghdad – when the federal supreme court ordered Kurdistan to hand over oil extracted from its territories to the federal authorities.Then earlier this month, a commercial court in the Iraqi capital annulled contracts between the Kurds and foreign firms, after the oil ministry in Baghdad filed a judicial complaint.Iraq, the second largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, sits on enormous reserves, and revenues from the sector feed 90 percent of the federal government budget.It exports an average of 3.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, while production in Kurdistan amounts to just over 450,000 bpd.In a bid to defuse tensions, Kurdistan proposed setting up two companies specialised in oil exploration and marketing that would coordinate with Baghdad, a spokesperson for the regional government said earlier this month.Baghdad has fought to regain control of output from fields in Kurdistan since the autonomous region began marketing oil independently more than a decade ago.\n",

      "Fed set for another big rate hike with economy on knife’s edge\n",
      "July 25, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501118687/fed-set-for-another-big-rate-hike-with-economy-on-knifes-edge/\n",
      "AFP – US central bankers face an increasingly difficult balancing act as they struggle to douse scorching inflation while still keeping the economy growing, though they have made it clear they are willing to risk a recession.But with war still raging in Ukraine, and Covid-19 causing ongoing issues in Asia, avoiding an economic downturn will require luck and depend on many factors outside the Federal Reserve’s control.As families struggle to make ends meet amid surging prices for gas, food and housing, and a rising number of Americans take on second jobs to pay the bills, Fed officials have made it clear that fighting inflation is their top priority even if that means inflicting pain.The Fed holds its two-day policy meeting next week, where it is expected to hike the benchmark borrowing rate on Wednesday by another three-quarters of a percentage point in its aggressive campaign to cool demand and ease price pressures.Despite a healthy job market with near-record low unemployment, workers are seeing their wage gains overwhelmed by sky-high consumer prices that rose by a new 40-year high of 9.1 percent in June.Slowing the economy is likely to cause more job losses, but policymakers want to avoid at all costs the greater pain of a price spiral that becomes entrenched or spins out of control.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, herself a former Fed chief, warned last week that achieving a “soft landing… will require skill and good luck.”Aggressive rate hikesFormer Fed vice chair Donald Kohn agreed.“It’s a very complicated, multi-dimensional issue,” Kohn told AFP, especially due to the ongoing supply chain uncertainty.After flooding the world’s largest economy with support during the pandemic – zero interest rates and a steady stream of liquidity into the financial system – Fed policymakers were congratulating themselves on how quickly the economy recovered, regaining millions of jobs in a matter of months.But they were caught flat-footed by the rapid run-up in prices, as Americans flush with cash due to massive government aid went on a spending spree, buying up cars, houses and other goods at a time when the global supply chain was still bogged down by pandemic lockdowns that continue in China.The Fed finally began liftoff –taking the policy interest rate off zero – in March, starting with a 25-basis-point increase, followed by 50 in May and 75 in June.Higher lending costs make it more expensive to borrow funds to buy cars and homes or expand businesses, which should cool demand, while also making it more attractive to save rather than spend.Other major central banks have followed suit, including the European Central Bank that made its first move last week.Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would consider either a 50 or 75 bps hike at the July meeting, and most economists expect a repeat of the June three-quarter-point increase.Fed Governor Christopher Waller recently floated the idea of a mammoth 100-bps hike, which would be the first since the US central bank started using the federal funds rate for policy in the early 1990s.The equivalent amount of tightening in a single move hasn’t been seen since the early 1980s, when then-Fed chief Paul Volcker was on a crusade to crush a wage-price inflationary spiral.Mixed dataBut even Waller noted that it is important not to move too fast, and a full point hike would only be called for if data continue to show accelerating price increases.“I think they will probably discuss 100 basis points just because the inflation picture is still very bad,” said Julie Smith, a Lafayette College economics professor.But some recent data “indicate that previous rate increases have very likely started to work,” she said in an interview.Housing prices have skyrocketed, hitting new records repeatedly, even as interest rates have risen, and consumer spending continues to increase, leading some economists to warn of a contraction in the second quarter.But there are signs of cracks, including falling home sales, a dramatic drop in mortgage applications and an increasing share of spending going to necessities.Officials have said the US economy is strong enough to withstand higher rates without a serious downturn, but others, including former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, say they are overly optimistic and job losses will have to rise sharply in order to tame inflation.Kohn said it will be important for Powell to communicate clearly about what data the Fed is looking for to slow or pause the rate hike cycle.“I think a fairly shallow recession,” with higher unemployment than the 3.7 percent the Fed projected last month, “will be necessary to break this inflation spiral,” he said.“But, boy, the amount of uncertainty around it is just huge.”\n",

      "Cambodia’s export to other RCEP countries up 10 pct in H1\n",

      "Cambodia’s total export to other member countries of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) totaled 3.28 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of 2022, up 10 percent year-on-year, a report of the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.During the January-June period this year, Cambodia’s top three export destinations were Vietnam, China and Japan, the report said, adding that the kingdom shipped products worth 1.17 billion dollars to Vietnam, 612 million dollars to China and 542 million dollars to Japan.The RCEP free trade agreement comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — and their five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.Cambodian Ministry of Commerce’s undersecretary of state and spokesman Penn Sovicheat said RCEP and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), which both took effect on Jan. 1 this year, are a contributing factor to boost Cambodia’s exports.“Our export growth is a testament to the larger market access of our products to other RCEP member countries with tariff concessions,” he told a press conference in Phnom Penh on Thursday. “The two FTAs have been giving a boost to our economic growth in the long term.”Meanwhile, Sovicheat said China has played a leading role in assisting the least developed countries (LDCs) including Cambodia through preferential tariffs, noting that the support was crucial to helping the LDCs boost their economic development.Senior economist Ky Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said that through RCEP, Cambodia could be a hub-and-spoke model of distributing goods from China in the ASEAN region.“RCEP has served as a catalyst for regional and global economic growth and undoubtedly, all participating countries will benefit from it at different levels,” he told Xinhua. “It will help Cambodia and other member countries to quicken their economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.”Joseph Matthews, a senior professor at the BELTEI International University in Phnom Penh, said RCEP is becoming a driving force for regional economic growth in the post-pandemic era.“This mega trade deal has created huge opportunities for countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Malaysia to market their products and commodities in such a big market and multiply their profits and gains,” he told Xinhua.According to a World Bank’s research paper, Cambodia ranked third after Vietnam and Malaysia in terms of real income gains and export growth under RCEP.“We look at RCEP as the longer benefit … Cambodia is the third country that will gain the most from RCEP after Vietnam and Malaysia,” World Bank senior country economist Ly Sodeth said at a press conference in Phnom Penh on June 30. “So, Cambodia potentially benefits a lot from RCEP.” Xinhua\n",

      "Inflation in Cambodia continuously increased in the first months of this year, from 1.22% in February to 1.61% in March and skyrocketing to 7.2% in May – the highest recorded in the country in the last decade, according to the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC).Cambodian press have quoted NBC Governor Chea Chanto as saying that the impact of the rising prices of oil and food in the world causes inflation in the country to increase continuously.Speaking at a conference on July 20 to review the bank’s operation in the first half of 2022 and its orientations in the remaining months of this year, Chanto said the prolonged Russia – Ukraine conflict and the sanctions against Russia have pushed food and oil prices up, causing inflation hike in Cambodia.The NBC is considering implementing a monetary policy to control inflation and support economic recovery in the direction of stabilising the exchange rate, maintaining the purchasing power of the local currency and the income of vulnerable groups.To promote economic growth, the monetary easing policy will continue to be implemented by ensuring that the required reserve ratio is kept at 7%, thus helping financial institutions and banks to have more cash.Chanto said the NBC has tightened regulations in a prudent manner before the COVID-19 crisis, especially in increasing capital, increasing liquidity and contingency.These factors allow NBC and the Cambodian banking system to relax regulations during the pandemic and in the economic recovery period, he added.

      "Tourism sector in Cambodia is on the path of revival and the $150 million Tourism Recovery Co-Financing Scheme launched by the government through the SME Bank of Cambodia with the support of 19 partner financial institutions on July 1 has provided the much-needed booster for it.In an exclusive interview with Khmer Times, Dr. Lim Aun, CEO of the SME Bank of Cambodia, recently said the scheme targets tourism-related businesses whose operations were either completely closed or part of products or service facilities defunct, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The targetted businesses include hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and other products and services supporting the tourism sector. The Royal Government of Cambodia had approved a budget of $75 million for financing the businesses with favourable conditions that include a low interest rate of 6.5 percent, a credit period of up to seven years and a preferential payment period up to 12 months, Dr Aun said. The remaining $75 million will be provided by the partner financial institutions.On May 17, 2022, Dr. Aun Porn Moniroth, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy and Finance and Chairman of the National Committee for Tourism Development, inaugurated the scheme.On June 16, 2022, SME Bank of Cambodia signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 19 financial institutions to implement the scheme. They include Canadia Bank, Sathapana Bank, ACLEDA Bank, Chip Mong Bank, Vattanac Asia Bank Limited, Wing Bank, Prince Bank, CIMB Bank, Cambodia Post Bank, Phnom Penh Commercial Bank, RHB Bank, Sakhom Bank, Hattha Bank, Phillip Bank, Asia-Pacific Bank, Foreign Trade Bank of Cambodia, PRASAC MFI, Khema Microfinance Institution and LOLC Microfinance Institution.Dr Aun said loans up to $400,000 or the riel equivalent will be provided for business restoration, improvement and modernization, expansion and diversification in preparation for enhancing national tourism and international tourist arrivals.He urged the business owners in the tourism sector in need of financial support to contact the partner bank branches. The scheme is open for a period of two years but it can be closed earlier, depending on the offtake of the fund to be provided on a first-come-first-served basis.Dr Aun said that under the co-financing mechanism, the fund is not a grant but a loan with a grace period for the first year. The repayment tenure is up to seven years of which the first 12 months require interest payment only while instalment payment of both principal and interest will start from the 13th month onwards.The grace period allowed is to ease the cash flow of business owners during the improvement or renovation work. The main objective of the scheme is to help those pandemic-hit tourism businesses and therefore, new business ventures are not eligible for this loan, Dr Aun clarified.To a question, he said, in addition to the co-financing scheme, the sector may get a lot more assistance as the government’s policy is to support Cambodia’s tourism to the maximum extent possible, including but not limited to the promotion of domestic tourism, the opening of vaccine tourism, easing of travel restriction and exemption of fee on issuing licences for reopening of hotels and restaurants.According to the Ministry of Tourism, three strategies on priority are its focus, Dr Aun pointed out. First, it is to provide economic support to the tourism private sector and generate tourism employment. Second, to promote domestic tourism and also to attract international tourists and the third priority is to enhance tourism governance.Tourism contributed significantly to the development of the national economy as well as job creation for Cambodians. Unfortunately, between 2020 and 2021, the tourism sector declined sharply due to Covid-19 and caused many enterprises in the sector reducing, suspending or closing their operations. The government, on its part, launched a number of intervention measures to revive the economy, especially on December 16, 2021, it announced the implementation of the strategic framework and programmes to restore and promote Cambodia’s economic growth and adopted the policy of living with Covid-19 as the new normal for 2021-2023.\n",

      "Passengers of the Philippines will have more options going to Cambodia as flag carrier Philippine Airlines will mount additional flights from Manila beginning September 1.According to the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), PAL is the only carrier that has a direct flight to Cambodia.From the current four times a week schedule, five weekly flights between the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and Phnom Penh will be offered.PAL is increasing its flight frequencies between Manila and Phnom Penh due to travel demand between the two capital cities, spokesperson Cielo Villaluna told the Philippine News Agency Tuesday night.“We are also serving travelers between Phnom Penh and cities in the United States, Australia, Japan, and in other countries in the PAL’s network. Manila is a convenient connecting hub for (the passengers),” she said.Starting September 1, the flight from Manila to Cambodia will be offered every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 9:50 p.m.From September 2, the services from Cambodia to Manila will be at 12:45 a.m. every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. canadianinquirer.net\n",

      "Cambodia needs $50 billion for multi-mode transportation connectivity\n",
      "July 22, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501117273/cambodia-needs-50-billion-for-multi-mode-transportation-connectivity/\n",
      "Cambodia needs $50 billion to implement a draft 10-year master plan for multi-mode transportation connectivity and logistics, according to a release by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT).Koy Sodany, secretary of state of Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), said that the draft master plan will include projects for the development of infrastructure for road, railway, expressway, waterway, seaway transportation systems, ports, airports and logistics.Mak Sideth, director general of the general department of waterway and maritime transport, and ports at MPWT, told Khmer Times that the draft master plan is expected to be completed in 2024 or 2025.“We have just started conducting the assessment, which would take normally at least one year to complete, but we will strive to complete it as early as possible,” said Sideth.“The plan will include the restoration of waterway and maritime transportation systems by digging waterway deeper and wider,” he said.Currently, vessels transport goods to Cambodia through Cai Mep International Terminal and Vung Tau Port in Ba Ria-Vung Tau province, both having about 15 metre depth.He said larger vessels would wait for the water level to increase to reach Cambodia. When bigger vessels transport goods to Cambodia, they have to transit at Cai Mep and Vung Tau while small vessels from Cambodia would transfer the goods.“Bigger vessels from countries would be able to come when we restore the waterway transportation systems. Some customers also complained that our water is shallow and they have to get through some ports where they have to pay more fees and submit documents,” he said.Vietnam requires customers who ship used goods to Cambodia to request documents from Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade, he pointed out.Any customer who uses either waterway or land way to transport goods stored in containers to Cambodia but transit in Vietnam is required to pay $100 per 20 cubic metres and $200 per 40 cubic metres.“Ultimately our end consumers have to pay high prices for goods. They said the fee is charged for the development of Ho Chi Minh City,” he said.The plan would allow Cambodia’s customers to ship goods directly into the country through either Kep province which could receive between 1,000 tonnes and 3,000 tonnes from vessels or Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, according to the official.He added that after vessels arrive at Kep or Sihanoukville, they can come further to S’ang district in Kandal province. The vessels can then reach Phnom Penh through Phnom Penh Autonomous Port through a fresh waterway as the draft master plan also includes the development of connectivity from Bassac River to the coastal ports of Cambodia.“So, when we have the master plan implemented, vessels will no longer have to get through Vietnam,” said Sideth.“The master plan also includes plans to develop seeder ports, but we have to consider all aspects. We will examine where to set up the seeder ports for easier shipment of goods and how many of them should be set up dependent on the budget,” he said.The draft master plan was presented in a discussion meeting between Sodany and Danucha Pichayanan, secretary general of the National Economic and Social Development Council of Thailand (NESDC).Sodany signed the MoU with Pichayanan on Wednesday. It is aimed at building cooperation in developing policies that include logistics, legal framework, regulations, institutional framework, facilitation mechanisms, etc.   \n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501117272/cambodia-india-vow-to-boost-trade-and-investment/\n",
      "Cambodia and India are committed to coordinating and promoting business and investment activities to further boost economic and trade growth between the two countries.During a meeting on Wednesday, Chhuon Dara, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Commerce, warmly welcomed an Indian delegation at the Ministry of Commerce.“Cambodia and India have long historical relations with each other. The Ministry of Commerce supports and cooperates with the Embassy of India in Cambodia and the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia in order to further promote trade and investment cooperation between the two countries,” Dara said.Meanwhile, Karthik Tallam, Honorary Consul of Cambodia in Bangalore, India, said the purpose of the Indian delegation’s visit was to seek the support and cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce in setting up the Business Excellence Program Awards 2022 organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia with the aim of celebrating the 70th anniversary of Cambodia-India diplomatic ties.The event will take place from 8 to 10 December 2022 in Phnom Penh, with the participation of Cambodian state institutions as well as the Indian private sector and more than 200 companies are expected to take part.The two sides expressed their commitment to continue cooperating, facilitating and promoting business and investment activities to boost economic and trade growth between the two countries.Cambodia Chamber of Commerce vice-president Lim Heng said that trade between the two nations remains limited and that with a massive population and a thriving technology sector, an FTA would benefit Cambodia a great deal.“Once there is a bilateral trade agreement, it will not only increase the flow of trade between the two countries but will also be an opportunity for Cambodia to attract international investors in Cambodia to produce goods that are in high demand in India,” he said.He also pointed out that trade between the two countries had been on a steady upward trajectory prior to the Covid-19 crisis.A recent report from the Ministry of Commerce showed that in 2021 the total trade volume between Cambodia and India amounted to US $311 million. While Cambodia exported to India more than US $126 million worth of goods, Indian exports to Cambodia reached US $185 million.\n",

      "July 22, 2022\n",
      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501117276/kingdoms-exports-to-rcep-countries-up-10-h1/\n",
      "Cambodia’s exports to the member countries of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) amounted to $3.28 billion in the first half of this year, up 10 percent from $2.99 billion over the same period last year, the Ministry of Commerce’s data showed yesterday.For the January-June period, Cambodia’s top three export destinations were Vietnam, China and Japan which shipped products worth $1,174 million, $612 million, and $542 million, respectively.The RCEP pact has contributed to the Kingdom’s export growth in the first six months this year, confirmed the ministry’s Under-Secretary of State, Penn Sovicheat.“The implementation of the RCEP has contributed to an increase of Cambodia’s exports,” Sovicheat said at a press conference at the Government’s Spokesman Unit yesterday.The RCEP free trade agreement came into force on January 1, 2022.The regional trade pact comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries including the 10-member Asean – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam  – and five trading partners, namely China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.The world’s largest trade bloc, the RCEP has a combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $26.2 trillion, representing around 30 percent of the global GDP, 28 percent of the global trade, and 32.5 percent of the global investment.The Kingdom’s exports to the RCEP member countries during this period accounted for 28.8 percent of the country’s total export of $11.37 billion.The trade volume (exports and imports together) between Cambodia and the RCEP’s member countries topped $16.24 billion, up nine percent compared to the same period last year.The spokesman attributed the growth in the exports to the Cambodia-made products’ quality that has won the confidence of buyers and consumers.“Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Cambodia’s exports continued to grow as some countries failed to supply to their markets,” he said.The government resumed socio-economic activities late last year following the high rate of vaccination against Covid-19.Lim Heng, Vice President of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, said that the herd immunity against Covid-19 has enabled the country to maintain its factory production chains and meet the purchase orders.\n",

      "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501117432/high-logistics-cost-can-harm-cambodias-export-capabilities/\n",
      "The handling charge for a 40-foot container in Cambodia is double that of neighbouring countries of Thailand and Vietnam while the export clearance fees remain four to five times higher compared to the neighbours, a World Bank report said recently, warning that the cost of logistics in the Kingdom is partially to blame for being a drag on its ability to compete with nearby supply chains for the export market.A 40-foot container typically runs about $1,200 in handling charges at the terminal in Cambodia, which is up from $1,000 per container pre-Covid-19 and also double that of neighbouring ports in Bangkok in Thailand and Cai Mep in Vietnam, the report said.Other price differences, where Cambodia runs higher than neighbouring ports, are seen in export clearance fees for containers in the range of $220 to $250, compared to $60 in Thailand and Vietnam\n",
      "or $50 in Japan.Meanwhile, average cross-border container costs into Vietnam range anywhere from $217 at the Prey Vor border to $410 at the Bavet border crossing, the report found.The June economic update on Cambodia, released this month by the World Bank, aimed to look at the country’s goods movement systems as it bounces back from Covid-19 and manages through current headwinds, such as rising fuel prices and the effects of the war in Ukraine.“The high cost of logistics and other supply chain challenges have become an impediment to Cambodia’s ability to compete, particularly with estimates pointing to companies in the country expected to quadruple the amount of product they’re moving through various transportation channels,” the report said.“Increasing supply chain reliability and service quality is key to improving Cambodia’s logistics performance, as predictability is not just a matter of time and cost but also a component of shipment quality,” the report added.The World Bank report provided a number of suggestions for the near and long term in the country, including regular monitoring of ports, boosting rail, automation, incentives to raise logistics industry standards, a hotline people can call into to report violations and supporting e-commerce and other types of specialty logistics.“The pandemic has resulted in unprecedented global supply chain disruptions, which do not yet show clear signs of waning,” the report said, pointing to the “pressing” need for “transformative reforms” when it comes to the country’s transportation systems if it is to recover from the effects of the pandemic on its garment factories, tourism and exports such as agriculture.It’s estimated that transportation accounts for nearly 10 percent of overall logistics costs and the price of fuel serves as an additional strain. “Transport operating costs are currently under severe upward pressure due to the high price of diesel, exacerbated by the characteristics of the operators’ fleet,” the report said.It also described the drayage (transport of freight from an ocean port to a destination) fleets in Cambodia as dating “back to the last century,” consisting of second-hand and third-hand models from Korea and Vietnam.“Upgrading the goods vehicle fleet should be seen as a priority from both a logistics cost perspective and an environmental perspective, as there is an urgent need to burn less and cleaner fuel of a higher grade than at present,” the report said.Duties and fees run anywhere from 35 percent to 65 percent, making it difficult for trucking companies to make the investment in newer vehicles, it added.Even as demand slowed, the country’s merchandise exports made gains in the first quarter, led by garments, travel-related products and footwear. The three sectors combined to total $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 25.2 percent from the year-ago period.Cambodia’s garment exports grew 20.4 percent in the first quarter from a year ago to total $2.1 billion while its economy is projected to grow 4.5 percent this year, albeit the recovery is expected to be “uneven,” according to the report, which added “increased integration into regional and global value chains has made efficient logistics and supply chains central to Cambodia’s development strategy.”\n",

      "AFP – US carmaker Ford is preparing to cut several thousand jobs to reduce costs and intensify its transition to electric vehicles, US media reported on Wednesday.The group is expected to announce the elimination of more than 4,000 jobs in the coming weeks, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people close to the matter.Factory workers are not expected to be affected, the report said.Bloomberg said as many as 8,000 jobs could be affected.Contacted by AFP, a Ford spokesman did not want to comment on “speculation”.But the group has scheduled a conference call on Thursday to give an update on its plan to transform to electric vehicles.“Key Ford executives will provide details on how the company is building out its industrial system to reach a global production run rate of 600,000 EVs, growing to more than 2 million EV annual global run rate by 2026,” the company said in a statement.“As we’ve said lots of times, to deliver our Ford+ transformation and lead an exciting and disruptive new era of electric and connected vehicles, we’re reshaping our work and modernizing our organization across all of the automotive business units and the entire company,” the spokesperson said in his message.“We’ve laid out clear targets for our cost structure so that we’re lean and fully competitive with the best in the industry.”Challenged by Tesla and other start-ups, traditional carmakers have accelerated production of their electric models in recent years.In March, Ford announced the creation of a new dedicated entity: Ford Model e.At the time, it said it wanted to manufacture two million electric vehicles a year by 2026 — a third of its global production – and planned to spend $50 billion on them.The company’s executives also said they wanted to cut spending on traditional vehicles to $3 billion a year. \n",
